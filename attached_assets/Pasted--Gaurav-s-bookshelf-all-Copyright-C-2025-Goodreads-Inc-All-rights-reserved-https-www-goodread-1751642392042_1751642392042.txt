With the fourth largest population in the world, inhabiting islands that span an eighth of the globe, Indonesia became the first country to rid itself of colonial rule after WWII.<br /><br />Renowned scholar David Van Reybrouck captures a period of tumult and chaos to tell the story of Indonesia's momentous revolution, known as the "Revolusi." Encompassing several hundred years of history, he details the formation of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese invasion that followed, and the young rebels who engaged in armed resistance once the occupation ended. British and Dutch troops were sent to restore order and keep peace, but instead ignited the first modern war of decolonization. America, too, became embroiled with the Indonesians' fierce struggle for freedom. That struggle inspired independence movements in Asia, Africa, and the Arab world, especially in the wake of Indonesia's monumental 1955 Bandung Conference, the first global conference without the West. The whole world had become involved in Revolusi, and the whole world was changed by it.<br /><br />A landmark history, Revolusi cements Indonesia's struggle for independence as one of the defining dramas of the twentieth century and entirely reframes our understanding of post-colonialism.

The case has captured the nation’s imagination, but Kajii refuses to speak with the press, entertaining no visitors. That is until journalist Rika Machida writes a letter asking for her recipe for beef stew, and Kajii can’t resist writing back.<br /><br />Rika, the only woman in her news office, works late each night, rarely cooking more than ramen. As the visits unfold between her and the steely Kajii, they are closer to a master class in food than journalistic research. Rika hopes this gastronomic exchange will help her soften Kajii, but it seems that Rika might be the one changing. Do she and Kajii have more in common than she once thought?<br /><br />Inspired by the real case of a convicted con woman and serial killer—the “Konkatsu Killer”—Asako Yuzuki’s Butter is a vivid, unsettling exploration of misogyny, obsession, romance, and the transgressive pleasures of food in Japan. 464 Asako Yuzuki 0063236419 Gaurav 0 Tue, 01 Jul 2025 12:10:01 -0700 Tue, 01 Jul 2025 12:10:01 -0700 to-read 3.53 2017 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213212694-butter?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Butter: A Novel of Food and Murder" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1724011874l/213212694._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Asako Yuzuki<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.53<br/> book published: 2017<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/07/01<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7700308374?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 01 Jul 2025 07:35:18 -0700 Athens: A History of the World's First Democracy https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7700308374?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 43309953 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557782392l/43309953._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557782392l/43309953._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557782392l/43309953._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1557782392l/43309953.jpg A history of the world’s first democracy from its beginnings in Athens circa fifth century B.C. to its downfall 200 years later<br /><br />The first democracy, established in ancient Greece more than 2,500 years ago, has served as the foundation for every democratic system of government instituted down the centuries. In this lively history, author Thomas N. Mitchell tells the full and remarkable story of how a radical new political order was born out of the revolutionary movements that swept through the Greek world in the seventh and sixth centuries B.C., how it took firm hold and evolved over the next two hundred years, and how it was eventually undone by the invading Macedonian conquerors, a superior military power.<br /> <br />Mitchell’s superb history addresses the most crucial issues surrounding this first paradigm of democratic governance, including what initially inspired the political beliefs underpinning it, the ways the system succeeded and failed, how it enabled both an empire and a cultural revolution that transformed the world of arts and philosophy, and the nature of the Achilles heel that hastened the demise of Athenian democracy.  368 Thomas N.

Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.”— Edward Bernays A seminal and controversial figure in the history of political thought and public relations, Edward Bernays (1891–1995), pioneered the scientific technique of shaping and manipulating public opinion, which he famously dubbed “engineering of consent.” During World War I, he was an integral part of the U.S. Committee on Public Information (CPI), a powerful propaganda apparatus that was mobilized to package, advertise and sell the war to the American people as one that would “Make the World Safe for Democracy.” The CPI would become the blueprint in which marketing strategies for future wars would be based upon. Bernays applied the techniques he had learned in the CPI and, incorporating some of the ideas of Walter Lipmann, as well as his uncle, Sigmund Freud, became an outspoken proponent of propaganda as a tool for democratic and corporate manipulation of the population. His 1928 bombshell Propaganda lays out his eerily prescient vision for using propaganda to regiment the collective mind in a variety of areas, including government, politics, art, science and education. To read this book today is to frightfully comprehend what our contemporary institutions of government and business have become in regards to organized manipulation of the masses. 168 Edward L.

While the volume rests on the assumption that science is not autonomous, the book is distinguished by its global perspective. Examining knowledge systems within a planetary frame forces thinking about boundaries that silence or affect knowledge-building. Consideration of ethnoscience and technoscience research within a common framework is overdue for raising questions about deeply held beliefs and assumptions we all carry about scientific knowledge. We need a perspective on how to regard different science traditions because public controversies should not be about a glorified science or a despicable science. 334 Laura Nader 0415914655 Gaurav 0 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:19:50 -0700 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:19:50 -0700 to-read 4.07 1996 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/893097.Naked_Science?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Naked Science" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348228624l/893097._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Laura Nader<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.07<br/> book published: 1996<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/06/27<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7688703131?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:19:22 -0700 Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7688703131?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 52962238 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630251271l/52962238._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630251271l/52962238._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630251271l/52962238._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630251271l/52962238.jpg From legendary investor Ray Dalio, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Principles, who has spent half a century studying global economies and markets, Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order examines history’s most turbulent economic and political periods to reveal why the times ahead will likely be radically different from those we’ve experienced in our lifetimes—and to offer practical advice on how to navigate them well.<br /><br />A few years ago, Ray Dalio noticed a confluence of political and economic conditions he hadn’t encountered before. They included huge debts and zero or near-zero interest rates that led to massive printing of money in the world’s three major reserve currencies; big political and social conflicts within countries, especially the US, due to the largest wealth, political, and values disparities in more than 100 years; and the rising of a world power (China) to challenge the existing world power (US) and the existing world order. The last time that this confluence occurred was between 1930 and 1945. This realization sent Dalio on a search for the repeating patterns and cause/effect relationships underlying all major changes in wealth and power over the last 500 years.<br /><br />In this remarkable and timely addition to his Principles series, Dalio brings readers along for his study of the major empires—including the Dutch, the British, and the American—putting into perspective the “Big Cycle” that has driven the successes and failures of all the world’s major countries throughout history. He reveals the timeless and universal forces behind these shifts and uses them to look into the future, offering practical principles for positioning oneself for what’s ahead. 576 Ray Dalio 1982160276 Gaurav 0 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:19:22 -0700 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:19:22 -0700 to-read 4.26 2021 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52962238-principles-for-dealing-with-the-changing-world-order?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1630251271l/52962238._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Ray Dalio<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.26<br/> book published: 2021<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/06/27<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7688691858?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:10:45 -0700 Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7688691858?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 282108 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320529351l/282108._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320529351l/282108._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320529351l/282108._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320529351l/282108.jpg <i>Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9781400076789</i><br /><br />This widely acclaimed biography provides a vivid and riveting account of Stalin and his courtiers—killers, fanatics, women, and children—during the terrifying decades of his supreme power. In a seamless meshing of exhaustive research and narrative, Simon Sebag Montefiore gives us the everyday details of a monstrous life. We see Stalin playing his deadly game of power and paranoia at debauched dinners at Black Sea villas and in the apartments of the Kremlin. We witness first-hand how the dictator and his magnates carried out the Great Terror and the war against the Nazis, and how their families lived in this secret world of fear, betrayal, murder, and sexual degeneracy. Montefiore gives an unprecedented understanding of Stalin’s dictatorship, and a Stalin as human and complicated as he is brutal. 848 Simon Sebag Montefiore Gaurav 0 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:10:45 -0700 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:10:45 -0700 to-read 4.12 2003 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/282108.Stalin?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320529351l/282108._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Simon Sebag Montefiore<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.12<br/> book published: 2003<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/06/27<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7688689893?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:09:13 -0700 The Last Emperor of Mexico: The Dramatic Story of the Habsburg Archduke Who Created a Kingdom in the New World https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7688689893?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 57007981 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1613508319l/57007981._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1613508319l/57007981._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1613508319l/57007981._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1613508319l/57007981.jpg <b>The true operatic tragedy of Maximilian and Carlota, the European aristocrats who stumbled into power in Mexico—and faced bloody consequences.</b><br /><br />In the 1860s, Napoleon III, intent on curbing the rise of American imperialism, persuaded a young Austrian archduke and a Belgian princess to leave Europe and become the emperor and empress of Mexico. They and their entourage arrived in a Mexico ruled by terror, where revolutionary fervor was barely suppressed by French troops. When the United States, now clear of its own Civil War, aided the rebels in pushing back Maximilian’s imperial soldiers, the French army withdrew, abandoning the young couple. The regime fell apart. Maximilian was executed by a firing squad and Carlota, secluded in a Belgian castle, descended into madness.<br /><br />Assiduously researched and vividly told, <i>The Last Emperor of Mexico</i> is a dramatic story of European hubris, imperialist aspirations clashing with revolutionary fervor, and the Old World breaking from the New. 336 Edward Shawcross 1541674197 Gaurav 0 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:09:13 -0700 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:09:12 -0700 to-read 4.23 2021 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57007981-the-last-emperor-of-mexico?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Last Emperor of Mexico: The Dramatic Story of the Habsburg Archduke Who Created a Kingdom in the New World" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1613508319l/57007981._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Edward Shawcross<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.23<br/> book published: 2021<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/06/27<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7688688656?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:08:12 -0700 India: 5,000 Years of History on the Subcontinent https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7688688656?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 219550725 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1732672302l/219550725._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1732672302l/219550725._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1732672302l/219550725._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1732672302l/219550725._SY475_.jpg A dazzling new history of the Indian subcontinent and its diverse peoples in global context—from antiquity to today<br /><br />Much of world history is Indian history. Home today to one in four people, the subcontinent has long been densely populated and deeply connected to Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas through migration and trade. In this magisterial history, Audrey Truschke tells the fascinating story of the region historically known as India—which includes today’s India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and parts of Afghanistan—and the people who have lived there.<br /><br />A sweeping account of five millennia, from the dawn of the Indus Valley Civilization to the twenty-first century, this engaging and richly textured narrative chronicles the most important political, social, religious, intellectual, and cultural events. And throughout, it describes how the region has been continuously reshaped by its astonishing diversity, religious and political innovations, and social stratification.<br /><br />Here, readers will learn about Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, and Sikhism; the Vedas and Mahabharata; Ashoka and the Mauryan Empire; the Silk Road; the Cholas; Indo-Persian rule; the Mughal Empire; European colonialism; national independence movements; the 1947 Partition of India; the recent rise of Hindu nationalism; the challenges of climate change; and much more. Emphasizing the diversity of human experiences on the subcontinent, the book presents a wide range of voices, including those of women, religious minorities, lower classes, and other marginalized groups.<br /><br />You cannot understand India today without appreciating its deeply contested history, which continues to drive current events and controversies. A comprehensive and innovative book, India is essential reading for anyone who is interested in the past, present, or future of the subcontinent. 712 Audrey Truschke 0691221227 Gaurav 0 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:08:12 -0700 Fri, 27 Jun 2025 04:08:11 -0700 to-read 3.56 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219550725-india?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="India: 5,000 Years of History on the Subcontinent" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1732672302l/219550725._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Audrey Truschke<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.56<br/> book published: <br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/06/27<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7681811602?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 24 Jun 2025 15:14:39 -0700 Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7681811602?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 357486 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316637138l/357486._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316637138l/357486._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316637138l/357486._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316637138l/357486.jpg <b>Written by the winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature</b><br /><br />On April 26, 1986, the worst nuclear reactor accident in history occurred in Chernobyl and contaminated as much as three quarters of Europe. <i>Voices from Chernobyl</i> is the first book to present personal accounts of the tragedy.

And one of the triggers for that war would be a nuclear missile inbound toward the United States.<br /> <br />Every generation, a journalist has looked deep into the heart of the nuclear military establishment: the technologies, the safeguards, the plans, and the risks. These investigations are vital to how we understand the world we really live in—where one nuclear missile will beget one in return, and where the choreography of the world’s end requires massive decisions made on seconds’ notice with information that is only as good as the intelligence we have.<br /> <br />Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen’s <i>Nuclear War: A Scenario</i> explores this ticking-clock scenario, based on dozens of exclusive new interviews with military and civilian experts who have built the weapons, have been privy to the response plans, and have been responsible for those decisions should they have needed to be made. <i>Nuclear War: A Scenario</i> examines the handful of minutes after a nuclear missile launch. It is essential reading, and unlike any other book in its depth and urgency. 400 Annie Jacobsen 0593476093 Gaurav 0 Tue, 24 Jun 2025 08:08:43 -0700 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:41:34 -0800 to-read 4.36 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182733784-nuclear-war?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Nuclear War: A Scenario" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1698060837l/182733784._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Annie Jacobsen<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.36<br/> book published: 2024<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/06/24<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3214915830?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 24 Jun 2025 08:08:28 -0700 The First Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill George Washington https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3214915830?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 39863169 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1540921089l/39863169._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1540921089l/39863169._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1540921089l/39863169._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1540921089l/39863169._SY475_.jpg In 1776, an elite group of soldiers were handpicked to serve as George Washington’s bodyguards. Washington trusted them; relied on them. But unbeknownst to Washington, some of them were part of a treasonous plan. In the months leading up to the Revolutionary War, these traitorous soldiers, along with the Governor of New York William Tryon and Mayor David Mathews, launched a deadly plot against the most important member of the military: George Washington himself.<br /><br />This is the story of the secret plot and how it was revealed. It is a story of leaders, liars, counterfeiters, and jailhouse confessors. It also shows just how hard the battle was for George Washington—and how close America was to losing the Revolutionary War.<br /><br />Taking place during the most critical period of our nation’s birth, The First Conspiracy tells a remarkable and previously untold piece of American history that not only reveals George Washington’s character, but also illuminates the origins of America’s counterintelligence movement that led to the modern day CIA. 413 Brad Meltzer 1250130336 Gaurav 0 Tue, 24 Jun 2025 08:08:28 -0700 Mon, 02 Mar 2020 09:38:36 -0800 to-read 3.77 2019 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39863169-the-first-conspiracy?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The First Conspiracy: The Secret Plot to Kill George Washington" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1540921089l/39863169._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Brad Meltzer<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.77<br/> book published: 2019<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/06/24<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195406593?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 24 Jun 2025 08:08:07 -0700 The Coming Wave: Technology, Power, and the Twenty-first Century's Greatest Dilemma https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195406593?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 90590134 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1685351813l/90590134._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1685351813l/90590134._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1685351813l/90590134._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1685351813l/90590134.jpg A warning of the unprecedented risks that AI and other fast-developing technologies pose to global order, and how we might contain them while we have the chance—from a co-founder of the pioneering artificial intelligence company DeepMind<br /><br />We are approaching a critical threshold in the history of our species.

But it is a challenging principle, subject to erosion in times of upheaval. Today, in democracies and authoritarian states around the world, it is on the retreat.<br /><br />In <i>Free Speech</i>, Jacob Mchangama traces the riveting legal, political, and cultural history of this idea. Through captivating stories of free speech’s many defenders—from the ancient Athenian orator Demosthenes and the ninth-century freethinker al-Rāzī, to the anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells and modern-day digital activists—Mchangama reveals how the free exchange of ideas underlies all intellectual achievement and has enabled the advancement of both freedom and equality worldwide. Yet the desire to restrict speech, too, is a constant, and he explores how even its champions can be led down this path when the rise of new and contrarian voices challenge power and privilege of all stripes.<br /><br />Meticulously researched and deeply humane, <i>Free Speech</i> demonstrates how much we have gained from this principle—and how much we stand to lose without it. 560 Jacob Mchangama 1541620348 Gaurav 0 Tue, 03 Jun 2025 16:12:37 -0700 Tue, 03 Jun 2025 16:12:37 -0700 currently-reading 5.00 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/215750547-free-speech?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Free Speech: A History from Socrates to Social Media" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1721739763l/215750547._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Jacob Mchangama<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 5.00<br/> book published: <br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/06/03<br/> shelves: currently-reading<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7623995537?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 03 Jun 2025 05:39:09 -0700 Don't Be Canada: How One Country Did Everything Wrong All At Once https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7623995537?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 223440724 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1739400333l/223440724._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1739400333l/223440724._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1739400333l/223440724._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1739400333l/223440724._SY475_.jpg <b>A shocking, darkly hilarious exploration of how Canada, a country once admired for its stability and moderation, became a global cautionary tale.</b><br /><br /><br /><br />Drawing from real headlines, deep research, and extensive interviews, acclaimed journalist Tristin Hopper uncovers the bizarre missteps and policy experiments that have helped Canada set new global standards for disfunction. The examples are the real estate bubble that never bursts, Orwellian internet regulations, harm reduction policies that escalate harm, official health guidelines that recommended the use of glory holes in a pandemic, and a runaway euthanasia system that inspired the Wall Street Journal to declare, <i>“Welcome to Canada, the Doctor Will Kill You Now.”</i><br /><br /><br /><br />As sobering as it is comic, <i>Don’t Be Canada</i> examines the cascading consequences of extreme policies and tells the tragic story of a country that took its wealth, tolerance, and functionality for granted. <br /><br /><br /><br /> 164 Tristin Hopper 1998365360 Gaurav 4 Tue, 3 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000 Tue, 03 Jun 2025 05:39:09 -0700 Tue, 03 Jun 2025 05:38:55 -0700 4.37 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223440724-don-t-be-canada?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Don&#39;t Be Canada: How One Country Did Everything Wrong All At Once" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1739400333l/223440724._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Tristin Hopper<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.37<br/> book published: <br/> rating: 4<br/> read at: 2025/06/03<br/> date added: 2025/06/03<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3014672014?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sat, 10 May 2025 16:52:40 -0700 Salt: A World History https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3014672014?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 2715 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414608893l/2715._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414608893l/2715._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414608893l/2715._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414608893l/2715.jpg In his fifth work of nonfiction, Mark Kurlansky turns his attention to a common household item with a long and intriguing history: salt. The only rock we eat, salt has shaped civilization from the very beginning, and its story is a glittering, often surprising part of the history of humankind. A substance so valuable it served as currency, salt has influenced the establishment of trade routes and cities, provoked and financed wars, secured empires, and inspired revolutions.  484 Mark Kurlansky 0142001619 Gaurav 0 Sat, 10 May 2025 16:52:40 -0700 Wed, 16 Oct 2019 09:12:13 -0700 2021-targets, to-read 3.75 2002 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2715.Salt?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Salt: A World History" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1414608893l/2715._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Mark Kurlansky<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.75<br/> book published: 2002<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/05/10<br/> shelves: 2021-targets, to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7364254811?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sat, 10 May 2025 16:49:47 -0700 Oil: A Beginner's Guide (Beginner's Guides) https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7364254811?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 3387138 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398035122l/3387138._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398035122l/3387138._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398035122l/3387138._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398035122l/3387138.jpg Packed with fascinating facts and insight, this book will fuel dinner party debate, and provide readers with the science and politics behind the world’s most controversial resource. Without oil, there would be no globalisation, no plastic, little transport, and a global political landscape that few would recognise. It is the lifeblood of the modern world, and humanity’s dependence upon it looks set to continue for decades to come. In this captivating book, the author of the acclaimed A Beginner’s Guide, Vaclav Smil, explains all matters related to the ‘black stuff’, from its discovery in the earth, right through to the political maelstrom that surrounds it today. Author Vaclav Smil is Distinguished Professor in the Faculty of Environment at the University of Manitoba, Canada. He has written over 10 books on energy and been a keynote speaker at both the World Economic Forum and the Global Roundtable on Climate Change. He is the first non-American to receive the American Association for the Advancement of Science Award for Public Understanding of Science and Technology and is a Special Fellow of the Royal Society. 224 Vaclav Smil 1851685715 Gaurav 0 Sat, 10 May 2025 16:49:47 -0700 Fri, 28 Feb 2025 21:13:49 -0800 to-read 3.74 2008 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3387138-oil?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Oil: A Beginner&#39;s Guide (Beginner&#39;s Guides)" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1398035122l/3387138._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Vaclav Smil<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.74<br/> book published: 2008<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/05/10<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7556504573?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Fri, 09 May 2025 17:01:14 -0700 The Art of Intelligence https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7556504573?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 13590828 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1338185573l/13590828._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1338185573l/13590828._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1338185573l/13590828._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1338185573l/13590828.jpg A legendary CIA spy and counterterrorism expert tells the spellbinding story of his high-risk, action-packed career while illustrating the growing importance of America's intelligence officers and their secret missions<br /><br />For a crucial period, Henry Crumpton led the CIA's global covert operations against America's terrorist enemies, including al Qaeda. In the days after 9/11, the CIA tasked Crumpton to organize and lead the Afghanistan campaign. With Crumpton's strategic initiative and bold leadership, from the battlefield to the Oval Office, U.S. and Afghan allies routed al Qaeda and the Taliban in less than ninety days after the Twin Towers fell. At the height of combat against the Taliban in late 2001, there were fewer than five hundred Americans on the ground in Afghanistan, a dynamic blend of CIA and Special Forces. The campaign changed the way America wages war. This book will change the way America views the CIA.<br /><br />The Art of Intelligence draws from the full arc of Crumpton's espionage and covert action exploits to explain what America's spies do and why their service is more valuable than ever. From his early years in Africa, where he recruited and ran sources, from loathsome criminals to heroic warriors; to his liaison assignment at the FBI, the CIA's Counterterrorism Center, the development of the UAV Predator program, and the Afghanistan war; to his later work running all CIA clandestine operations inside the United States, he employs enthralling storytelling to teach important lessons about national security, but also about duty, honor, and love of country.<br /><br />No book like The Art of Intelligence has ever been written-not with Crumpton's unique perspective, in a time when America faced such grave and uncertain risk. It is an epic, sure to be a classic in the annals of espionage and war. 11 Henry A.

These were the brains behind the Nazis' once-indomitable war machine. So began Operation Paperclip, a decades-long, covert project to bring Hitler's scientists and their families to the United States.<br /><br />Many of these men were accused of war crimes, and others had stood trial at Nuremberg; one was convicted of mass murder and slavery. They were also directly responsible for major advances in rocketry, medical treatments, and the U.S. space program. Was Operation Paperclip a moral outrage, or did it help America win the Cold War?<br /><br />Drawing on exclusive interviews with dozens of Paperclip family members, colleagues, and interrogators, and with access to German archival documents (including previously unseen papers made available by direct descendants of the Third Reich's ranking members), files obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, and dossiers discovered in government archives and at Harvard University, Annie Jacobsen follows more than a dozen German scientists through their postwar lives and into a startling, complex, nefarious, and jealously guarded government secret of the twentieth century.<br /><br />In this definitive, controversial look at one of America's most strategic, and disturbing, government programs, Jacobsen shows just how dark government can get in the name of national security. 813 Annie Jacobsen 0316239828 Gaurav 0 Mon, 05 May 2025 13:23:58 -0700 Mon, 05 May 2025 13:23:57 -0700 to-read 4.57 2014 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333307-operation-paperclip?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Operation Paperclip: The Secret Intelligence Program That Brought Nazi Scientists to America" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1714033204l/17333307._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Annie Jacobsen<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.57<br/> book published: 2014<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/05/05<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7545690043?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Mon, 05 May 2025 13:23:53 -0700 No Longer Human https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7545690043?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 194746 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422638843l/194746._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422638843l/194746._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422638843l/194746._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422638843l/194746.jpg Osamu Dazai's <i>No Longer Human</i>, this leading postwar Japanese writer's second novel, tells the poignant and fascinating story of a young man who is caught between the breakup of the traditions of a northern Japanese aristocratic family and the impact of Western ideas. In consequence, he feels himself "disqualified from being human" (a literal translation of the Japanese title).<br /><br />Donald Keene, who translated this and Dazai's first novel, <i>The Setting Sun</i>, has said of the author's work: "His world … suggests Chekhov or possibly postwar France, … but there is a Japanese sensibility in the choice and presentation of the material. A Dazai novel is at once immediately intelligible in Western terms and quite unlike any Western book." His writing is in some ways reminiscent of Rimbaud, while he himself has often been called a forerunner of Yukio Mishima.<br /><br /><i>Cover painting by Noe Nojechowiz, from the collection of John and Barbara Duncan; design by Gertrude Huston</i> 176 Osamu Dazai Gaurav 0 Mon, 05 May 2025 13:23:53 -0700 Mon, 05 May 2025 13:23:53 -0700 to-read 3.99 1948 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/194746.No_Longer_Human?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="No Longer Human" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1422638843l/194746._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Osamu Dazai<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.99<br/> book published: 1948<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/05/05<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7545689805?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Mon, 05 May 2025 13:23:48 -0700 The Plantagenets: The Warrior Kings and Queens Who Made England https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7545689805?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 15811559 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366387829l/15811559._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366387829l/15811559._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366387829l/15811559._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1366387829l/15811559.jpg The first Plantagenet king inherited a blood-soaked kingdom from the Normans and transformed it into an empire stretched at its peak from Scotland to Jerusalem. In this epic history, Dan Jones vividly resurrects this fierce and seductive royal dynasty and its mythic world. <br /><br />We meet the captivating Eleanor of Aquitaine, twice queen and the most famous woman in Christendom; her son, Richard the Lionheart, who fought Saladin in the Third Crusade; and King John, a tyrant who was forced to sign Magna Carta, which formed the basis of our own Bill of Rights. <br /><br />This is the era of chivalry, of Robin Hood and the Knights Templar, the Black Death, the founding of Parliament, the Black Prince, and the Hundred Year’s War.

If you buy a book at the bookstore, you own it. You can take it home, scribble in the margins, put in on the shelf, lend it to a friend, sell it at a garage sale. But is the same thing true for the ebooks or other digital goods you buy? Retailers and copyright holders argue that you don't own those purchases, you merely license them. That means your ebook vendor can delete the book from your device without warning or explanation—as Amazon deleted Orwell's 1984 from the Kindles of surprised readers several years ago. These readers thought they owned their copies of 1984 . Until, it turned out, they didn't. In The End of Ownership , Aaron Perzanowski and Jason Schultz explore how notions of ownership have shifted in the digital marketplace, and make an argument for the benefits of personal property. Of course, ebooks, cloud storage, streaming, and other digital goods offer users convenience and flexibility. But, Perzanowski and Schultz warn, consumers should be aware of the tradeoffs involving user constraints, permanence, and privacy. The rights of private property are clear, but few people manage to read their end user agreements. Perzanowski and Schultz argue that introducing aspects of private property and ownership into the digital marketplace would offer both legal and economic benefits. But, most important, it would affirm our sense of self-direction and autonomy. If we own our purchases, we are free to make whatever lawful use of them we please. Technology need not constrain our freedom; it can also empower us. 372 Aaron Perzanowski Gaurav 0 Sun, 04 May 2025 07:16:10 -0700 Sun, 04 May 2025 07:16:10 -0700 to-read 4.05 2016 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32868592-the-end-of-ownership?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The End of Ownership: Personal Property in the Digital Economy" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1478230642l/32868592._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Aaron Perzanowski<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.05<br/> book published: 2016<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/05/04<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7480540192?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Mon, 21 Apr 2025 06:29:12 -0700 The Creative Act: A Way of Being https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7480540192?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 60965426 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663707011l/60965426._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663707011l/60965426._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663707011l/60965426._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663707011l/60965426.jpg <b>From the legendary music producer, a master at helping people connect with the wellsprings of their creativity, comes a beautifully crafted book many years in the making that offers that same deep wisdom to all of us. </b><br /><br />"A gorgeous and inspiring work of art on creation, creativity, the work of the artist. It will gladden the hearts of writers and artists everywhere, and get them working again with a new sense of meaning and direction. A stunning accomplishment." --Anne Lamott<br /><br />"<i>I set out to write a book about what to do to make a great work of art. Instead, it revealed itself to be a book on how to be." --Rick Rubin</i><br /><br />Many famed music producers are known for a particular sound that has its day. Rick Rubin is known for something else: creating a space where artists of all different genres and traditions can home in on who they really are and what they really offer. He has made a practice of helping people transcend their self-imposed expectations in order to reconnect with a state of innocence from which the surprising becomes inevitable. Over the years, as he has thought deeply about where creativity comes from and where it doesn't, he has learned that being an artist isn't about your specific output, it's about your relationship to the world. Creativity has a place in everyone's life, and everyone can make that place larger. In fact, there are few more important responsibilities.<br /><br /><i>The Creative Act</i> is a beautiful and generous course of study that illuminates the path of the artist as a road we all can follow. It distills the wisdom gleaned from a lifetime's work into a luminous reading experience that puts the power to create moments--and lifetimes--of exhilaration and transcendence within closer reach for all of us. 406 Rick Rubin 0593652886 Gaurav 3 Mon, 21 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000 Mon, 21 Apr 2025 06:29:12 -0700 Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:28:54 -0700 3.98 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60965426-the-creative-act?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Creative Act: A Way of Being" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663707011l/60965426._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Rick Rubin<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.98<br/> book published: 2023<br/> rating: 3<br/> read at: 2025/04/21<br/> date added: 2025/04/21<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7194436347?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 13 Apr 2025 17:19:02 -0700 The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Caused an Epidemic of Mental Illness https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7194436347?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 171681821 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1711573377l/171681821._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1711573377l/171681821._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1711573377l/171681821._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1711573377l/171681821._SY475_.jpg THE INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A Wall Street Journal Top 10 Book of 2024 • A Washington Post Notable Book • A New York Times Notable Book • The Goodreads Choice Award Nonfiction Book of the Year<br /><br />A must-read for all parents: the generation-defining investigation into the collapse of youth mental health in the era of smartphones, social media, and big tech—and a plan for a healthier, freer childhood.<br /><br />“With tenacity and candor, Haidt lays out the consequences that have come with allowing kids to drift further into the virtual world . . . While also offering suggestions and solutions that could help protect a new generation of kids.” —Shannon Carlin, ,i&gt;TIME, 100 Must-Read Books of 2024<br /><br />After more than a decade of stability or improvement, the mental health of adolescents plunged in the early 2010s. Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on many measures. Why?<br /><br />In <i>The Anxious Generation,</i> social psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the epidemic of teen mental illness that hit many countries at the same time. He then investigates the nature of childhood, including why children need play and independent exploration to mature into competent, thriving adults. Haidt shows how the “play-based childhood” began to decline in the 1980s, and how it was finally wiped out by the arrival of the “phone-based childhood” in the early 2010s. He presents more than a dozen mechanisms by which this “great rewiring of childhood” has interfered with children’s social and neurological development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism. He explains why social media damages girls more than boys and why boys have been withdrawing from the real world into the virtual world, with disastrous consequences for themselves, their families, and their societies.<br /><br />Most important, Haidt issues a clear call to action. He diagnoses the “collective action problems” that trap us, and then proposes four simple rules that might set us free. He describes steps that parents, teachers, schools, tech companies, and governments can take to end the epidemic of mental illness and restore a more humane childhood.<br /><br />Haidt has spent his career speaking truth backed by data in the most difficult landscapes—communities polarized by politics and religion, campuses battling culture wars, and now the public health emergency faced by Gen Z. We cannot afford to ignore his findings about protecting our children—and ourselves—from the psychological damage of a phone-based life. 400 Jonathan Haidt 0593655036 Gaurav 4 Sun, 13 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000 Sun, 13 Apr 2025 17:19:02 -0700 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 07:52:22 -0800 4.34 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/171681821-the-anxious-generation?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Caused an Epidemic of Mental Illness" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1711573377l/171681821._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Jonathan Haidt<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.34<br/> book published: 2024<br/> rating: 4<br/> read at: 2025/04/13<br/> date added: 2025/04/13<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7480534475?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:25:59 -0700 The Republic https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7480534475?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 30289 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925655l/30289._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925655l/30289._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925655l/30289._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925655l/30289.jpg Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, this classic text is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation, other questions are raised: what is goodness?; what is reality?; and what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as guardians of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by philosopher kings. 416 Plato 0140449140 Gaurav 0 Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:25:59 -0700 Fri, 11 Apr 2025 10:25:59 -0700 currently-reading 3.97 -400 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30289.The_Republic?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Republic" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386925655l/30289._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Plato<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.97<br/> book published: -400<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/04/11<br/> shelves: currently-reading<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7388699152?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:46:10 -0700 An African History of Africa: From the Dawn of Humanity to Independence https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7388699152?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 197055873 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1695804428l/197055873._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1695804428l/197055873._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1695804428l/197055873._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1695804428l/197055873._SY475_.jpg Everyone is originally from Africa, and this book is therefore for everyone.<br /><br />For too long, Africa's history has been neglected. Dominated by western narratives of slavery and colonialism, its past has been fragmented, overlooked and denied its rightful place in our global story.<br /><br />Now, Zeinab Badawi guides us through Africa's spectacular history, from the origins of humanity, through ancient civilisations and medieval empires with powerful queens and kings, to the miseries of conquest and the elation of independence.<br /><br />Seeking out occluded histories from across the continent, meeting with countless historians, anthropologists, archaeologists and local storytellers, and travelling through more than thirty countries, Badawi weaves together a fascinating new account of an epic, sweeping history of the oldest inhabited continent on the planet, told through the voices of Africans themselves. 531 Zeinab Badawi 0753560151 Gaurav 0 Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:46:10 -0700 Sun, 09 Mar 2025 08:46:10 -0700 to-read 4.03 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197055873-an-african-history-of-africa?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="An African History of Africa: From the Dawn of Humanity to Independence" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1695804428l/197055873._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Zeinab Badawi<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.03<br/> book published: 2024<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/03/09<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7194439446?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 04 Mar 2025 17:21:33 -0800 Another Kyoto https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7194439446?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 32312516 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475138530l/32312516._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475138530l/32312516._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475138530l/32312516._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475138530l/32312516._SX318_.jpg From Amazon: <br /><br />This book is the fruit of Alex Kerr's half-century of living in Japan and of lore gleaned from people he's met along the way: artists, Zen monks and Shinto priests, Japanese literati, and expat personalities from days past, such as legendary art dealer David Kidd. Kerr turns what we thought we knew about Kyoto inside-out, revealing the inner ideas behind simple things like walls, floors, and sliding doors.

In a world fraught with problems and challenges, we need to gauge how to achieve the greatest good with our money. This unique book provides a rich set of dialogs examining ten of the most serious challenges facing the world today: climate change, the spread of communicable diseases, conflicts and arms proliferation, access to education, financial instability, governance and corruption, malnutrition and hunger, migration, sanitation and access to clean water, and subsidies and trade barriers. Each problem is introduced by a world-renowned expert who defines the scale of the issue and examines a range of policy options. 208 Bjørn Lomborg 0521685710 Gaurav 0 Sun, 02 Mar 2025 02:21:36 -0800 Thu, 10 Oct 2019 21:40:37 -0700 to-read, peterson-recos 3.38 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/766674.How_to_Spend_50_Billion_to_Make_the_World_a_Better_Place?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="How to Spend $50 Billion to Make the World a Better Place" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348390434l/766674._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Bjørn Lomborg<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.38<br/> book published: <br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/03/02<br/> shelves: to-read, peterson-recos<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7194437226?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:43:32 -0800 How Big Things Get Done: The Surprising Factors That Determine the Fate of Every Project, from Home Renovations to Space Exploration and Everything In Between https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7194437226?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 61327449 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663709589l/61327449._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663709589l/61327449._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663709589l/61327449._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663709589l/61327449.jpg <b>The secrets to successfully planning and delivering projects on any scale—from home renovation to space exploration—by the world’s leading expert on megaprojects</b><br /> <br />“This book is important, timely, instructive, and entertaining. What more could you ask for?”—Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize–winning author of <i>Thinking, Fast and Slow</i><br /> <br />“Over-budget and over-schedule is an inevitability. Incompetence and grift is outrageous. Bent Flyvbjerg, with this terrific data-driven book, has shown that there is another way.”—Frank Gehry<br /><br />Nothing is more inspiring than a big vision that becomes a triumphant, new reality. Think of how the Empire State Building went from a sketch to the jewel of New York’s skyline in twenty-one months, or how Apple’s iPod went from a project with a single employee to a product launch in eleven months.<br /><br />These are wonderful stories. But most of the time big visions turn into nightmares. Remember Boston’s “Big Dig”? Almost every sizeable city in the world has such a fiasco in its backyard. In fact, no less than 92% of megaprojects come in over budget or over schedule, or both. The cost of California’s high-speed rail project soared from $33 billion to $100 billon—and won’t even go where promised. More modest endeavors, whether launching a small business, organizing a conference, or just finishing a work project on time, also commonly fail. Why?<br /><br />Understanding what distinguishes the triumphs from the failures has been the life’s work of Oxford professor Bent Flyvbjerg, dubbed “the world’s leading megaproject expert.” In <i>How Big Things Get Done</i>, he identifies the errors in judgment and decision-making that lead projects, both big and small, to fail, and the research-based principles that will make you succeed with yours. For example:<br /><br />• Understand your odds. If you don’t know them, you won’t win.<br />• Plan slow, act fast. Getting to the action quick feels right. But it’s wrong. <br />• Think right to left. Start with your goal, then identify the steps to get there.<br />• Find your Lego. Big is best built from small.<br />• Be a team maker. You won’t succeed without an “us.”<br />• Master the unknown unknowns. Most think they can’t, so they fail. Flyvbjerg shows how you can.<br />• Know that your biggest risk is you.<br /><br />Full of vivid examples ranging from the building of the Sydney Opera House, to the making of the latest Pixar blockbusters, to a home renovation in Brooklyn gone awry, <i>How Big Things Get Done</i> reveals how to get any ambitious project done—on time and on budget. 304 Bent Flyvbjerg 0593239512 Gaurav 5 Tue, 11 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000 Tue, 11 Feb 2025 20:43:32 -0800 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 07:52:38 -0800 Must read for every project manager! 4.28 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61327449-how-big-things-get-done?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="How Big Things Get Done: The Surprising Factors That Determine the Fate of Every Project, from Home Renovations to Space Exploration and Everything In Between" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1663709589l/61327449._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Bent Flyvbjerg<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.28<br/> book published: 2023<br/> rating: 5<br/> read at: 2025/02/11<br/> date added: 2025/02/11<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/>Must read for every project manager!<br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744709515?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sat, 01 Feb 2025 06:28:09 -0800 From Third World to First: The Singapore Story: 1965-2000 https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744709515?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 144409 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546080459l/144409._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546080459l/144409._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546080459l/144409._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546080459l/144409._SY475_.jpg Few gave tiny Singapore much chance of survival when it was granted independence in 1965. How is it, then, that today the former British colonial trading post is a thriving Asian metropolis with not only the world's number one airline, best airport, and busiest port of trade, but also the world's fourth–highest per capita real income?<br /><br />The story of that transformation is told here by Singapore's charismatic, controversial founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. Rising from a legacy of divisive colonialism, the devastation of the Second World War, and general poverty and disorder following the withdrawal of foreign forces, Singapore now is hailed as a city of the future. This miraculous history is dramatically recounted by the man who not only lived through it all but who fearlessly forged ahead and brought about most of these changes.<br /><br />Delving deep into his own meticulous notes, as well as previously unpublished government papers and official records, Lee details the extraordinary efforts it took for an island city–state in Southeast Asia to survive at that time.<br /><br />Lee explains how he and his cabinet colleagues finished off the communist threat to the fledgling state's security and began the arduous process of nation building: forging basic infrastructural roads through a land that still consisted primarily of swamps, creating an army from a hitherto racially and ideologically divided population, stamping out the last vestiges of colonial–era corruption, providing mass public housing, and establishing a national airline and airport.<br /><br />In this illuminating account, Lee writes frankly about his trenchant approach to political opponents and his often unorthodox views on human rights, democracy, and inherited intelligence, aiming always "to be correct, not politically correct." Nothing in Singapore escaped his watchful eye: whether choosing shrubs for the greening of the country, restoring the romance of the historic Raffles Hotel, or openly, unabashedly persuading young men to marry women as well educated as themselves. Today's safe, tidy Singapore bears Lee's unmistakable stamp, for which he is unapologetic: "If this is a nanny state, I am proud to have fostered one."<br /><br />Though Lee's domestic canvas in Singapore was small, his vigor and talent assured him a larger place in world affairs. With inimitable style, he brings history to life with cogent analyses of some of the greatest strategic issues of recent times and reveals how, over the years, he navigated the shifting tides of relations among America, China, and Taiwan, acting as confidant, sounding board, and messenger for them. He also includes candid, sometimes acerbic pen portraits of his political peers, including the indomitable Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, the poetry–spouting Jiang Zemin, and ideologues George Bush and Deng Xiaoping.<br /><br />Lee also lifts the veil on his family life and writes tenderly of his wife and stalwart partner, Kwa Geok Choo, and of their pride in their three children –– particularly the eldest son, Hsien Loong, who is now Singapore's deputy prime minister.<br /><br />For more than three decades, Lee Kuan Yew has been praised and vilified in equal measure, and he has established himself as a force impossible to ignore in Asian and international politics. <em>From Third World to First</em> offers readers a compelling glimpse into this visionary's heart, soul, and mind. 752 Lee Kuan Yew 0060197765 Gaurav 0 Sat, 01 Feb 2025 06:28:09 -0800 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:10:53 -0800 2021-targets, to-read 4.46 2000 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/144409.From_Third_World_to_First?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="From Third World to First: The Singapore Story: 1965-2000" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1546080459l/144409._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Lee Kuan Yew<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.46<br/> book published: 2000<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/02/01<br/> shelves: 2021-targets, to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7216682457?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sat, 01 Feb 2025 06:14:59 -0800 Red Memory: The Afterlives of China's Cultural Revolution https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7216682457?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 62586098 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1678575811l/62586098._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1678575811l/62586098._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1678575811l/62586098._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1678575811l/62586098.jpg “It is impossible to understand China today without understanding the Cultural Revolution,” Tania Branigan writes. During this decade of Maoist fanaticism between 1966 and 1976, children condemned parents, students condemned teachers, and as many as two million people died for their supposed political sins, while tens of millions were hounded, ostracized, and imprisoned. Yet in China this brutal and turbulent period exists, for the most part, as an absence; official suppression and personal trauma have conspired in national amnesia. <em>Red Memory</em> uncovers forty years of silence through the stories of individuals who lived through the madness. Deftly exploring how this era defined a generation and continues to impact China today, Branigan asks: What happens to a society when you can no longer trust those closest to you? What happens to the present when the past is buried, exploited, or redrawn? And how do you live with yourself when the worst is over? 304 Tania Branigan 1324051957 Gaurav 4 Sat, 1 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000 Sat, 01 Feb 2025 06:14:59 -0800 Tue, 14 Jan 2025 19:15:11 -0800 3.81 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62586098-red-memory?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Red Memory: The Afterlives of China&#39;s Cultural Revolution" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1678575811l/62586098._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Tania Branigan<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.81<br/> book published: 2023<br/> rating: 4<br/> read at: 2025/02/01<br/> date added: 2025/02/01<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7259166632?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:54:58 -0800 Final Cut: Art, Money, and Ego in the Making of Heaven's Gate, the Film That Sank United Artists https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7259166632?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 542635 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328756283l/542635._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328756283l/542635._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328756283l/542635._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328756283l/542635.jpg Heaven's Gate is probably the most discussed, least seen film in modern movie history. Its notoriety is so great that its title has become a generic term for disaster, for ego run rampant, for epic mismanagement, for wanton extravagance. It was also the film that brought down one of Hollywood’s major studios—United Artists, the company founded in 1919 by Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, D. W. Griffith, and Charlie Chaplin. Steven Bach was senior vice president and head of worldwide production for United Artists at the time of the filming of Heaven's Gate , and apart from the director and producer, the only person to witness the film’s evolution from beginning to end. Combining wit, extraordinary anecdotes, and historical perspective, he has produced a landmark book on Hollywood and its people, and in so doing, tells a story of human absurdity that would have made Chaplin proud. 432 Steven Bach 1557043744 Gaurav 0 Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:54:58 -0800 Sun, 26 Jan 2025 10:54:58 -0800 to-read 4.01 1985 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/542635.Final_Cut?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Final Cut: Art, Money, and Ego in the Making of Heaven&#39;s Gate, the Film That Sank United Artists" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328756283l/542635._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Steven Bach<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.01<br/> book published: 1985<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/01/26<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7194434566?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 12 Jan 2025 18:48:43 -0800 Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7194434566?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 199344846 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1697452251l/199344846._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1697452251l/199344846._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1697452251l/199344846._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1697452251l/199344846._SY475_.jpg From internationally renowned writer and Booker Prize winner Salman Rushdie, a searing, deeply personal account of enduring—and surviving—an attempt on his life thirty years after the fatwa that was ordered against him<br /> <br />On the morning of August 12, 2022, Salman Rushdie was standing onstage at the Chautauqua Institution, preparing to give a lecture on the importance of keeping writers safe from harm, when a man in black—black clothes, black mask—rushed down the aisle toward him, wielding a knife. His first thought: So it’s you. Here you are.<br /><br />What followed was a horrific act of violence that shook the literary world and beyond. Now, for the first time, and in unforgettable detail, Rushdie relives the traumatic events of that day and its aftermath, as well as his journey toward physical recovery and the healing that was made possible by the love and support of his wife, Eliza, his family, his army of doctors and physical therapists, and his community of readers worldwide.<br /><br />Knife is Rushdie at the peak of his powers, writing with urgency, with gravity, with unflinching honesty. It is also a deeply moving reminder of literature’s capacity to make sense of the unthinkable, an intimate and life-affirming meditation on life, loss, love, art—and finding the strength to stand up again. 209 Salman Rushdie 0593730240 Gaurav 5 Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000 Sun, 12 Jan 2025 18:48:43 -0800 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 07:51:47 -0800 Meditative 3.98 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199344846-knife?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1697452251l/199344846._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Salman Rushdie<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.98<br/> book published: 2024<br/> rating: 5<br/> read at: 2025/01/12<br/> date added: 2025/01/12<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/>Meditative<br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195390120?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:42:06 -0800 Be Ready When the Luck Happens https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195390120?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 209192698 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718043057l/209192698._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718043057l/209192698._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718043057l/209192698._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718043057l/209192698._SY475_.jpg <b>In her long-awaited memoir, Ina Garten—aka the Barefoot Contessa, author of thirteen bestselling cookbooks, beloved Food Network personality, Instagram sensation, and cultural icon—shares her personal story with readers hungry for a seat at her table.</b> <br /><br />Here, for the first time, Ina Garten presents an intimate, entertaining, and inspiring account of her remarkable journey. Ina’s gift is to make everything look easy, yet all her accomplishments have been the result of hard work, audacious choices, and exquisite attention to detail. In her unmistakable voice (no one tells a story like Ina), she brings her past and her process to life in a high-spirited and no-holds-barred memoir that chronicles decades of personal challenges, adventures (and misadventures) and unexpected career twists, all delivered with her signature combination of playfulness and purpose.<br /><br />From a difficult childhood to meeting the love of her life, Jeffrey, and marrying him while still in college, from a boring bureaucratic job in Washington, D.C., to answering an ad for a specialty food store in the Hamptons, from the owner of one Barefoot Contessa shop to author of bestselling cookbooks and celebrated television host, Ina has blazed her own trail and, in the meantime, taught millions of people how to cook and entertain.

But when no WMDs were found, the US and its allies were forced to examine the political and intelligence failures that had led to the invasion and the occupation, and the civil war that followed. One integral question has remained Why had Saddam seemingly sacrificed his long reign in power by giving the false impression that he possessed hidden stocks of dangerous weapons?<br /><br />The Achilles Trap masterfully untangles the people, ploys of power, and geopolitics that led to America’s disastrous war with Iraq, and, for the first time, details America’s fundamental miscalculations during its decades-long relationship with Saddam Hussein. Beginning with Saddam’s rise to power in 1979 and the birth of Iraq’s secret nuclear weapons program, Steve Coll traces Saddam’s motives by way of his inner circle. He brings to life the diplomats, scientists, family members, and generals who had no choice but to defer to their leader—a leader directly responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, as well as the torture or imprisonment of hundreds of thousands more. This was a man whose reasoning was impossible to reduce to a simple explanation, and the CIA and successive presidential administrations failed to grasp critical nuances of his paranoia, resentments, and inconsistencies – even when the stakes were incredibly high.<br /><br />Calling on unpublished and under-reported sources, interviews with surviving participants, and Saddam’s own transcripts and audio files, Coll pulls together an incredibly comprehensive portrait of a man who was convinced the world was out to get him, and acted accordingly. A work of great historical significance, The Achilles Trap is the definitive account of how corruptions of power, lies of diplomacy, and vanity – on both sides – led to avoidable errors of statecraft, ones that would enact immeasurable human suffering and forever change the political landscape as we know it. 576 Steve Coll 0525562265 Gaurav 0 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:41:53 -0800 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:41:53 -0800 to-read 4.36 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174156150-the-achilles-trap?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Achilles Trap: Saddam Hussein, the C.I.A., and the Origins of America&#39;s Invasion of Iraq" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1699241374l/174156150._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Steve Coll<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.36<br/> book published: 2024<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/01/09<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195387667?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:41:23 -0800 Revolusi: Indonesia and the Birth of the Modern World https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195387667?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 150778875 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1694885571l/150778875._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1694885571l/150778875._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1694885571l/150778875._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1694885571l/150778875._SY475_.jpg <b>From the internationally best-selling writer, a masterful account of the epic revolution that sparked the decolonization of the modern world.</b><br /><br />On a sunny Friday morning in August 1945, a handful of people raised a homemade cotton flag and, on behalf of 68 million compatriots, announced the birth of a new nation. With the fourth largest population in the world, inhabiting islands that span an eighth of the globe, Indonesia became the first country to rid itself of colonial rule after World War II.<br /><br />In this vivid history, renowned scholar and celebrated author of <em>Congo</em> David Van Reybrouck captures a period of extraordinary tumult and chaos to tell the story of Indonesia’s momentous revolution, known as the “Revolusi.” Encompassing several hundred years of history, he details the formation of the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese invasion that followed, and the young rebels who engaged in armed resistance once the occupation ended. British and Dutch troops were sent to restore order and keep peace, but instead ignited the first modern war of decolonization. America, too, became embroiled with the Indonesians’ fierce struggle for freedom. That struggle inspired independence movements in Asia, Africa, and the Arab world, especially in the wake of Indonesia’s monumental 1955 Bandung Conference, the first global conference without the West. The whole world had become involved in Revolusi, and the whole world was changed by it.<br /><br />Drawing on hundreds of interviews and eyewitness testimonies, David Van Reybrouck turns this vast and complex story into an utterly gripping narrative, written with remarkable historical clarity and filled with tragedy and passion. A landmark history, <em>Revolusi</em> cements Indonesia’s struggle for independence as one of the defining dramas of the twentieth century and entirely reframes our understanding of post-colonialism. 656 David Van Reybrouck 1324073691 Gaurav 0 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:41:23 -0800 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:41:23 -0800 to-read 4.46 2020 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150778875-revolusi?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Revolusi: Indonesia and the Birth of the Modern World" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1694885571l/150778875._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: David Van Reybrouck<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.46<br/> book published: 2020<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/01/09<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195386870?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:41:09 -0800 Wild Thing: A Life of Paul Gauguin https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195386870?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 210134232 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718917959l/210134232._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718917959l/210134232._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718917959l/210134232._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718917959l/210134232._SY475_.jpg <b>*Gorgeously illustrated with 70 colour images*<br /></b><i><br /><br /> You wish to teach me what is within learn first what is within you . . . I believe life has no meaning unless one lives it with a will, at least to the limit of one's will.</i><br /><br /> Paul Gauguin is chiefly known as the giant of post-Impressionist painting whose bold colours and compositions rocked the Western art world. It is less well known that he was a stockbroker in Paris and that after the 1882 financial crash he struggled to sustain his artistry, and worked as a tarpaulin salesman in Copenhagen, a canal digger in Panama City, and a journalist exposing the injustices of French colonial rule in Tahiti.<br /><br /> In <i>Wild Thing</i>, the award-winning biographer Sue Prideaux re-examines the adventurous and complicated life of the artist. She illuminates the people, places and ideas that shaped his his privileged upbringing in Peru and rebellious youth in France; the galvanising energy of the Paris art scene; meeting Mette, the woman who he would marry; formative encounters with Vincent van Gogh and August Strindberg; and the ceaseless draw of French Polynesia.<br /><br /> Prideaux conjures Gauguin's visual exuberance, his creative epiphanies, his fierce words and his flaws with acuity and sensitivity. Drawing from a wealth of new material and access to the artist's family, this myth-busting work invites us to see Gauguin anew. 0 Sue Prideaux 0571365957 Gaurav 0 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:41:09 -0800 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:41:09 -0800 to-read 4.44 2024 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210134232-wild-thing?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Wild Thing: A Life of Paul Gauguin" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718917959l/210134232._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Sue Prideaux<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.44<br/> book published: 2024<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/01/09<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195385761?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:40:50 -0800 A Man of Two Faces: A Memoir, a History, a Memorial https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195385761?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 124948662 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1680602071l/124948662._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1680602071l/124948662._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1680602071l/124948662._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1680602071l/124948662._SY475_.jpg With insight, humor, formal invention, and lyricism, in <i>A Man of Two Faces</i> Viet Thanh Nguyen rewinds the film of his own life. He expands the genre of personal memoir by acknowledging larger stories of refugeehood, colonization, and ideas about Vietnam and America, writing with his trademark sardonic wit and incisive analysis, as well as a deep emotional openness about his life as a father and a son.<br /><br />At the age of four, Nguyen and his family are forced to flee his hometown of Ban Mê Thuột and come to the USA as refugees. After being removed from his brother and parents and homed with a family on his own, Nguyen is later allowed to resettle into his own family in suburban San José. But there is violence hidden behind the sunny façade of what he calls AMERICA™. One Christmas Eve, when Nguyen is nine, while watching cartoons at home, he learns that his parents have been shot while working at their grocery store, the SàiGòn Mới, a place where he sometimes helps price tins of fruit with a sticker gun. Years later, as a teenager, the blood-stirring drama of the films of the Vietnam War such as <i>Apocalypse Now</i> throw Nguyen into an existential crisis: how can he be both American and Vietnamese, both the killer and the person being killed? When he learns about an adopted sister who has stayed back in Vietnam, and ultimately visits her, he grows to understand just how much his parents have left behind.

Wells and Rebecca West’s affair through 1930s nuclear physics to Flanagan's father working as a slave labourer near Hiroshima when the atom bomb is dropped, this genre-defying daisy chain of events reaches fission when Flanagan as a young man finds himself trapped in a rapid on a wild river not knowing if he is to live or to die.<br /><br />At once a love song to his island home and to his parents, this hypnotic melding of dream, history, literature, place and memory is about how reality is never made by realists and how our lives so often arise out of the stories of others and the stories we invent about ourselves. 280 Richard Flanagan 1761343467 Gaurav 0 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:40:32 -0800 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:40:32 -0800 to-read 4.18 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179455076-question-7?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Question 7" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1687419211l/179455076._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Richard Flanagan<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.18<br/> book published: 2023<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/01/09<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195384010?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:40:18 -0800 Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195384010?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 61966364 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1684782262l/61966364._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1684782262l/61966364._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1684782262l/61966364._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1684782262l/61966364.jpg <b>A stunning account of a colossal wildfire that collided with a city and a panoramic exploration of the rapidly changing relationship between fire and humankind</b><br /><br />In May 2016, Fort McMurray, the hub of Canada’s oil industry and America’s biggest foreign supplier, was overrun by wildfire. The multi-billion-dollar disaster melted vehicles, turned entire neighborhoods into firebombs, and drove 88,000 people from their homes in a single afternoon. Through the lens of this apocalyptic conflagration—the wildfire equivalent of Hurricane Katrina—John Vaillant warns that this was not a unique event but a shocking preview of what we must prepare for in a hotter, more flammable world.<br /><br />Fire has been a partner in our evolution for millennia, shaping culture, civilization, and, very likely, our brains. Fire has enabled us to cook our food, defend and heat our homes, and power the machines that drive our titanic economy. Yet this volatile energy source has always threatened to elude our control, and in our new age of intensifying climate change, we are seeing its destructive power unleashed in previously unimaginable ways.<br /><br />With masterly prose and a cinematic eye, Vaillant takes us on a riveting journey through the intertwined histories of North America’s oil industry and the birth of climate science, to the unprecedented devastation that modern forest fires wreak, and into lives forever changed by these disasters. His urgent work is a book for—and from—our new century of fire, which has only just begun. 432 John Vaillant 1524732850 Gaurav 0 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:40:18 -0800 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:40:18 -0800 to-read 4.31 2023 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61966364-fire-weather?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1684782262l/61966364._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: John Vaillant<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.31<br/> book published: 2023<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/01/09<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195383049?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:40:01 -0800 Super-Infinite: The Transformations of John Donne https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/7195383049?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 59851731 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1649028605l/59851731._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1649028605l/59851731._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1649028605l/59851731._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1649028605l/59851731.jpg <b>From standout scholar Katherine Rundell, <i>Super-Infinite</i> presents a sparkling and very modern biography of John Donne: the poet of love, sex, and death.</b><br /><br />Sometime religious outsider and social disaster, sometime celebrity preacher and establishment darling, John Donne was incapable of being just one thing.<br /><br />In his myriad lives he was a scholar of law, a sea adventurer, a priest, an MP - and perhaps the greatest love poet in the history of the English language. Along the way he converted from Catholicism to Protestantism, was imprisoned for marrying a sixteen-year old girl without her father's consent; struggled to feed a family of ten children; and was often ill and in pain. He was a man who suffered from black surges of misery, yet expressed in his verse many breathtaking impressions of electric joy and love. 352 Katherine Rundell 0374607400 Gaurav 0 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:40:01 -0800 Thu, 09 Jan 2025 12:40:01 -0800 to-read 4.14 2022 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59851731-super-infinite?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Super-Infinite: The Transformations of John Donne" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1649028605l/59851731._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Katherine Rundell<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.14<br/> book published: 2022<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2025/01/09<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1242647331?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 09 Jan 2025 08:11:22 -0800 Meditations https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1242647331?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 30659 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421618636l/30659._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421618636l/30659._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421618636l/30659._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1421618636l/30659.jpg Written in Greek by the only Roman emperor who was also a philosopher, without any intention of publication, the <i>Meditations</i> of Marcus Aurelius offer a remarkable series of challenging spiritual reflections and exercises developed as the emperor struggled to understand himself and make sense of the universe.

Two months since that moment of brief, bright surveillance by agents unknown.<br /><br />Two months of silence while a world holds its breath.<br /><br />Now some half-derelict space probe, sparking fitfully past Neptune’s orbit, hears a whisper from the edge of the solar system: a faint signal sweeping the cosmos like a lighthouse beam. Whatever’s out there isn’t talking to us. It’s talking to some distant star, perhaps. Or perhaps to something closer, something en route.<br /><br />So who do you send to force introductions on an intelligence with motives unknown, maybe unknowable? Who do you send to meet the alien when the alien doesn’t want to meet?<br /><br />You send a linguist with multiple personalities, her brain surgically partitioned into separate, sentient processing cores. You send a biologist so radically interfaced with machinery that he sees X-rays and tastes ultrasound, so compromised by grafts and splices he no longer feels his own flesh. You send a pacifist warrior in the faint hope she won’t be needed, and a fainter hope she’ll do any good if she is needed. You send a monster to command them all, an extinct hominid predator once called “vampire,” recalled from the grave with the voodoo of recombinant genetics and the blood of sociopaths. And you send a synthesist – an informational topologist with half his mind gone – as an interface between here and there, a conduit through which the Dead Center might hope to understand the Bleeding Edge.<br /><br />You send them all to the edge of interstellar space, praying you can trust such freaks and retrofits with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they’ve been sent to find.<br /><br />But you’d give anything for that to be true, if you only knew what was waiting for them… 384 Peter Watts 0765312182 Gaurav 0 Wed, 07 Aug 2024 21:35:15 -0700 Wed, 21 Oct 2020 11:20:52 -0700 15-most-important-science-fiction-b, to-read 4.01 2006 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48484.Blindsight?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Blindsight (Firefall, #1)" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924412l/48484._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Peter Watts<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.01<br/> book published: 2006<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2024/08/07<br/> shelves: 15-most-important-science-fiction-b, to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/957324972?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Wed, 07 Aug 2024 19:23:43 -0700 Capital: A Critique of Political Economy Volume 1 https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/957324972?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 325785 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718913375l/325785._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718913375l/325785._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718913375l/325785._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1718913375l/325785._SY475_.jpg <i>Capital</i>, one of Marx's major and most influential works, was the product of thirty years close study of the capitalist mode of production in England, the most advanced industrial society of his day. This new translation of <i>Volume One</i>, the only volume to be completed and edited by Marx himself, avoids some of the mistakes that have marred earlier versions and seeks to do justice to the literary qualities of the work.

It is the word of God whose truth was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad through the angel Gabriel over a period of 23 years. As it was revealed, so it was committed to memory by his companions, though written copies were also made by literate believers during the lifetime of the Prophet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The first full compilation was by Abu Bakar, the first Caliph, and it was then recompiled in the original dialect by the third Caliph Uthman, after the best reciters had fallen in battle. Muslims believe that the truths of The Holy Qur'an are fully and authentically revealed only in the original classical Arabic. However, as the influence of Islam grows and spreads to the modern world, it is recognised that translation is an important element in introducing and explaining Islam to a wider audience.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This translation, by Abdullah Yusuf Ali, is considered to be the most faithful rendering available in English. 380 Abdullah Yusuf Ali Gaurav 0 Wed, 07 Aug 2024 18:33:38 -0700 Wed, 16 Oct 2019 09:16:28 -0700 to-read, samharris-recos 4.14 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23574576-the-holy-qur-an?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Holy Qur&#39;an" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1437316106l/23574576._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Abdullah Yusuf Ali<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.14<br/> book published: <br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2024/08/07<br/> shelves: to-read, samharris-recos<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/704849462?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Wed, 07 Aug 2024 10:53:17 -0700 1Q84 Book 1 (1Q84, #1) https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/704849462?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 6443834 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329955413l/6443834._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329955413l/6443834._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329955413l/6443834._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329955413l/6443834.jpg 1949年にジョージ・オーウェルは、近未来小説としての『1984』を刊行した。<br />そして2009年、『1Q84』は逆の方向から1984年を描いた近過去小説である。<br />そこに描かれているのは「こうであったかもしれない」世界なのだ。<br />私たちが生きている現在が、「そうではなかったかもしれない」世界であるのと、ちょうど同じように。 554 Haruki Murakami 4103534222 Gaurav 0 Wed, 07 Aug 2024 10:53:17 -0700 Tue, 27 Aug 2013 03:17:44 -0700 to-read 4.02 2009 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6443834-1q84-book-1?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="1Q84 Book 1 (1Q84, #1)" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1329955413l/6443834._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Haruki Murakami<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.02<br/> book published: 2009<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2024/08/07<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/957325105?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 10 Jan 2023 08:00:02 -0800 Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/957325105?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 1842 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453215833l/1842._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453215833l/1842._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453215833l/1842._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453215833l/1842._SY475_.jpg "Diamond has written a book of remarkable scope ... one of the most important and readable works on the human past published in recent years."<br /><br />Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and a national bestseller: the global account of the rise of civilization that is also a stunning refutation of ideas of human development based on race.<br /><br />In this "artful, informative, and delightful" (William H. McNeill, New York Review of Books) book, Jared Diamond convincingly argues that geographical and environmental factors shaped the modern world. Societies that had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed writing, technology, government, and organized religion—as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war—and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.<br /><br />Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, the Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science, the Rhone-Poulenc Prize, and the Commonwealth Club of California's Gold Medal 498 Jared Diamond 0739467352 Gaurav 0 Tue, 10 Jan 2023 08:00:02 -0800 Wed, 04 Jun 2014 01:06:24 -0700 bill-gates-suggested, to-read, 100-2023-history 4.04 1997 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1842.Guns_Germs_and_Steel?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1453215833l/1842._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Jared Diamond<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.04<br/> book published: 1997<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2023/01/10<br/> shelves: bill-gates-suggested, to-read, 100-2023-history<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5251118602?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 10 Jan 2023 07:59:57 -0800 The Guns of August https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5251118602?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 40779082 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617037342l/40779082._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617037342l/40779082._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617037342l/40779082._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1617037342l/40779082._SY475_.jpg The Proud Tower, the Pulitzer Prize–winning The Guns of August, and The Zimmerman Telegram comprise Barbara W. Tuchman’s classic histories of the First World War era<br /><br />In this landmark, Pulitzer Prize–winning account, renowned historian Barbara W. Tuchman re-creates the first month of World War I: thirty days in the summer of 1914 that determined the course of the conflict, the century, and ultimately our present world. Beginning with the funeral of Edward VII, Tuchman traces each step that led to the inevitable clash. And inevitable it was, with all sides plotting their war for a generation. Dizzyingly comprehensive and spectacularly portrayed with her famous talent for evoking the characters of the war’s key players, Tuchman’s magnum opus is a classic for the ages. 658 Barbara W.

Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Abraham Lincoln waited in their hometowns for the results from the Republican National Convention in Chicago. When Lincoln emerged as the victor, his rivals were dismayed and angry.<br /><br />Throughout the turbulent 1850s, each had energetically sought the presidency as the conflict over slavery was leading inexorably to secession and civil war. That Lincoln succeeded, Goodwin demonstrates, was the result of a character that had been forged by experiences that raised him above his more privileged and accomplished rivals. He won because he possessed an extraordinary ability to put himself in the place of other men, to experience what they were feeling, to understand their motives and desires.<br /><br />It was this capacity that enabled Lincoln as president to bring his disgruntled opponents together, create the most unusual cabinet in history, and marshal their talents to the task of preserving the Union and winning the war.<br /><br />We view the long, horrifying struggle from the vantage of the White House as Lincoln copes with incompetent generals, hostile congressmen, and his raucous cabinet. He overcomes these obstacles by winning the respect of his former competitors, and in the case of Seward, finds a loyal and crucial friend to see him through.<br /><br />This brilliant multiple biography is centered on Lincoln's mastery of men and how it shaped the most significant presidency in the nation's history. 916 Doris Kearns Goodwin Gaurav 0 Tue, 10 Jan 2023 07:59:46 -0800 Wed, 16 Oct 2019 09:12:49 -0700 to-read, 100-2023-history 4.27 2005 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2199.Team_of_Rivals?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1676201263l/2199._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Doris Kearns Goodwin<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.27<br/> book published: 2005<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2023/01/10<br/> shelves: to-read, 100-2023-history<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5251117869?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 10 Jan 2023 07:59:41 -0800 1776 https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/5251117869?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 1067 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1306787560l/1067._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1306787560l/1067._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1306787560l/1067._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1306787560l/1067.jpg In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence - when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper.Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, 1776 is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, an his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known.At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books - Nathaniel Green, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of Winter.But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost - Washington, who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's 1776 is another landmark in the literature of American history. 386 David McCullough 0743226720 Gaurav 0 Tue, 10 Jan 2023 07:59:41 -0800 Tue, 10 Jan 2023 07:59:37 -0800 100-2023-history, to-read 4.10 2005 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1067.1776?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="1776" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1306787560l/1067._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: David McCullough<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.10<br/> book published: 2005<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2023/01/10<br/> shelves: 100-2023-history, to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3014672070?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Tue, 10 Jan 2023 07:59:33 -0800 The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3014672070?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 767171 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331223772l/767171._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331223772l/767171._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331223772l/767171._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1331223772l/767171.jpg Hitler boasted that The Third Reich would last a thousand years. It lasted only 12. But those 12 years contained some of the most catastrophic events Western civilization has ever known.<p>No other powerful empire ever bequeathed such mountains of evidence about its birth and destruction as the Third Reich. When the bitter war was over, and before the Nazis could destroy their files, the Allied demand for unconditional surrender produced an almost hour-by-hour record of the nightmare empire built by Adolph Hitler. This record included the testimony of Nazi leaders and of concentration camp inmates, the diaries of officials, transcripts of secret conferences, army orders, private letters—all the vast paperwork behind Hitler's drive to conquer the world.</p><p>The famed foreign correspondent and historian William L. Shirer, who had watched and reported on the Nazis since 1925, spent five and a half years sifting through this massive documentation.

It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. <br /><br />As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson's Paris "interest" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. <br /><br />Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer's son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. <br /><br />At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. <br /><br />Much about John Adams's life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate Boston in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. <br /><br />It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James's, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. <br /><br />This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, John Adams is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived. 751 David McCullough 0743223136 Gaurav 0 Tue, 10 Jan 2023 07:59:28 -0800 Tue, 27 Aug 2013 03:11:09 -0700 to-read, 100-2023-history 4.08 2001 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2203.John_Adams?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="John Adams" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1478144278l/2203._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: David McCullough<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.08<br/> book published: 2001<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2023/01/10<br/> shelves: to-read, 100-2023-history<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3214913768?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 15 Apr 2021 23:58:23 -0700 Blowout: Corrupted Democracy, Rogue State Russia, and the Richest, Most Destructive Industry on Earth https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3214913768?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 44767265 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1558401356l/44767265._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1558401356l/44767265._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1558401356l/44767265._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1558401356l/44767265.jpg In 2010, the words “earthquake swarm” entered the lexicon in Oklahoma. That same year, a trove of Michael Jackson memorabilia—including his iconic crystal-encrusted white glove—was sold at auction for over $1 million to a guy who was, officially, just the lowly forestry minister of the tiny nation of Equatorial Guinea. And in 2014, Ukrainian revolutionaries raided the palace of their ousted president and found a zoo of peacocks, gilded toilets, and a floating restaurant modeled after a Spanish galleon. Unlikely as it might seem, there is a thread connecting these events, and Rachel Maddow follows it to its crooked source: the unimaginably lucrative and equally corrupting oil and gas industry.<br /><br /> With her trademark black humor, Maddow takes us on a switchback journey around the globe, revealing the greed and incompetence of Big Oil and Gas along the way, and drawing a surprising conclusion about why the Russian government hacked the 2016 U.S. election. She deftly shows how Russia’s rich reserves of crude have, paradoxically, stunted its growth, forcing Putin to maintain his power by spreading Russia’s rot into its rivals, its neighbors, the West’s most important alliances, and the United States. Chevron, BP, and a host of other industry players get their star turn, most notably ExxonMobil and the deceptively well-behaved Rex Tillerson. The oil and gas industry has weakened democracies in developed and developing countries, fouled oceans and rivers, and propped up authoritarian thieves and killers. But being outraged at it is, according to Maddow, “like being indignant when a lion takes down and eats a gazelle. You can’t really blame the lion. It’s in her nature.”<br /><br /> <i> Blowout</i> is a call to contain the lion: to stop subsidizing the wealthiest businesses on earth, to fight for transparency, and to check the influence of the world’s most destructive industry and its enablers. The stakes have never been higher. As Maddow writes, “Democracy either wins this one or disappears.” 406 Rachel Maddow 0525575472 Gaurav 0 Thu, 15 Apr 2021 23:58:23 -0700 Mon, 02 Mar 2020 09:36:58 -0800 to-read 4.33 2019 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767265-blowout?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Blowout: Corrupted Democracy, Rogue State Russia, and the Richest, Most Destructive Industry on Earth" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1558401356l/44767265._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Rachel Maddow<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.33<br/> book published: 2019<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/04/15<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3438812697?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Mon, 25 Jan 2021 03:42:22 -0800 The Penguin History of the World https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3438812697?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 18925701 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475977973l/18925701._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475977973l/18925701._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475977973l/18925701._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1475977973l/18925701.jpg This is a completely new and updated edition of J.

As head of the Los Alamos Laboratory, he oversaw the successful effort to beat the Nazis in the race to develop the first atomic bomb—a breakthrough that was to have eternal ramifications for mankind and that made Oppenheimer the “Father of the Atomic Bomb.” But with his actions leading up to that great achievement, he also set himself on a dangerous collision course with Senator Joseph McCarthy and his witch-hunters. In Robert A Life Inside the Center , Ray Monk, author of peerless biographies of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell, goes deeper than any previous biographer in the quest to solve the enigma of Oppenheimer’s motivations and his complex personality.<br />     The son of German-Jewish immigrants, Oppenheimer was a man of phenomenal intellectual attributes, driven by an ambition to overcome his status as an outsider and penetrate the heart of political and social life. As a young scientist, his talent and drive allowed him to enter a community peopled by the great names of twentieth-century physics—men such as Niels Bohr, Max Born, Paul Dirac, and Albert Einstein—and to play a role in the laboratories and classrooms where the world was being changed forever, where the secrets of the universe, whether within atomic nuclei or collapsing stars, revealed themselves.<br />     But Oppenheimer’s path went beyond one of assimilation, scientific success, and world fame. The implications of the discoveries at Los Alamos weighed heavily upon this fragile and complicated man. In the 1930s, in a climate already thick with paranoia and espionage, he made suspicious connections, and in the wake of the Allied victory, his attempts to resist the escalation of the Cold War arms race led many to question his loyalties.<br />     Through compassionate investigation and with towering scholarship, Ray Monk’s Robert Oppenheimer tells an unforgettable story of discovery, secrecy, impossible choices, and unimaginable destruction. 848 Ray Monk 0385504071 Gaurav 3 Sun, 3 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000 Mon, 11 Jan 2021 23:36:58 -0800 Thu, 05 Feb 2015 01:17:57 -0800 4.18 2012 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12041966-robert-oppenheimer?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Robert Oppenheimer: His Life and Mind (A Life Inside the Center)" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344371583l/12041966._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Ray Monk<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.18<br/> book published: 2012<br/> rating: 3<br/> read at: 2021/01/03<br/> date added: 2021/01/11<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3382339186?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:19:15 -0800 India After Gandhi: The History of the World's Largest Democracy https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3382339186?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 356824 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500471959l/356824._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500471959l/356824._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500471959l/356824._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1500471959l/356824._SY475_.jpg A magisterial account of the pains, the struggles, the humiliations, and the glories of the world's largest and least likely democracy, Ramachandra Guha's <i>India After Gandhi</i> is a breathtaking chronicle of the brutal conflicts that have rocked a giant nation and the extraordinary factors that have held it together.

Bread, cash, dosh, dough, loot, lucre, moolah, readies, the wherewithal: Call it what you like, it matters. To Christians, love of it is the root of all evil. To generals, it’s the sinews of war. To revolutionaries, it’s the chains of labor. But in The Ascent of Money, Niall Ferguson shows that finance is in fact the foundation of human progress. What’s more, he reveals financial history as the essential backstory behind all history. With the clarity and verve for which he is known, Ferguson elucidates key financial institutions and concepts by showing where they came from. What is money? What do banks do? What’s the difference between a stock and a bond? Why buy insurance or real estate? And what exactly does a hedge fund do? This is history for the present. Ferguson travels to post-Katrina New Orleans to ask why the free market can’t provide adequate protection against catastrophe. He delves into the origins of the subprime mortgage crisis. 442 Niall Ferguson 1594201927 Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:18:49 -0800 Wed, 21 May 2014 22:38:00 -0700 to-read, 2021-targets 3.90 2007 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2714607-the-ascent-of-money?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1297236908l/2714607._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Niall Ferguson<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.90<br/> book published: 2007<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: to-read, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3014677960?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:18:21 -0800 Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3014677960?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 35696171 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1502223499l/35696171._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1502223499l/35696171._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1502223499l/35696171._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1502223499l/35696171._SY475_.jpg If you think the world is coming to an end, think again: people are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives, and while our problems are formidable, the solutions lie in the Enlightenment ideal of using reason and science.<br /><br />Is the world really falling apart? Is the ideal of progress obsolete? In this elegant assessment of the human condition in the third millennium, cognitive scientist and public intellectual Steven Pinker urges us to step back from the gory headlines and prophecies of doom, which play to our psychological biases. Instead, follow the data: In seventy-five jaw-dropping graphs, Pinker shows that life, health, prosperity, safety, peace, knowledge, and happiness are on the rise, not just in the West, but worldwide. This progress is not the result of some cosmic force. It is a gift of the Enlightenment: the conviction that reason and science can enhance human flourishing.<br /><br />Far from being a naïve hope, the Enlightenment, we now know, has worked. But more than ever, it needs a vigorous defense. The Enlightenment project swims against currents of human nature–tribalism, authoritarianism, demonization, magical thinking–which demagogues are all too willing to exploit. Many commentators, committed to political, religious, or romantic ideologies, fight a rearguard action against it. The result is a corrosive fatalism and a willingness to wreck the precious institutions of liberal democracy and global cooperation.<br /><br />With intellectual depth and literary flair, Enlightenment Now makes the case for reason, science, and humanism: the ideals we need to confront our problems and continue our progress. 576 Steven Pinker 0525427570 Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:18:21 -0800 Wed, 16 Oct 2019 09:18:28 -0700 to-read, samharris-recos, 2021-targets 4.18 2018 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35696171-enlightenment-now?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1502223499l/35696171._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Steven Pinker<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.18<br/> book published: 2018<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: to-read, samharris-recos, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3004415205?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:17:42 -0800 Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3004415205?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 41716904 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544735124l/41716904._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544735124l/41716904._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544735124l/41716904._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544735124l/41716904.jpg In his international bestsellers <i>Guns, Germs and Steel</i> and<i> Collapse</i>, Jared Diamond transformed our understanding of what makes civilizations rise and fall. Now, in his third book in this monumental trilogy, he reveals how successful nations recover from crises while adopting selective changes -- a coping mechanism more commonly associated with individuals recovering from personal crises.<br /><br />Diamond compares how six countries have survived recent upheavals -- ranging from the forced opening of Japan by U.S. Commodore Perry's fleet, to the Soviet Union's attack on Finland, to a murderous coup or countercoup in Chile and Indonesia, to the transformations of Germany and Australia after World War Two. Because Diamond has lived and spoken the language in five of these six countries, he can present gut-wrenching histories experienced firsthand. These nations coped, to varying degrees, through mechanisms such as acknowledgment of responsibility, painfully honest self-appraisal, and learning from models of other nations. Looking to the future, Diamond examines whether the United States, Japan, and the whole world are successfully coping with the grave crises they currently face. Can we learn from lessons of the past? <br /><br />Adding a psychological dimension to the in-depth history, geography, biology, and anthropology that mark all of Diamond's books, <i>Upheaval </i>reveals factors influencing how both whole nations and individual people can respond to big challenges. The result is a book epic in scope, but also his most personal book yet. 512 Jared Diamond Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:17:42 -0800 Mon, 07 Oct 2019 10:51:28 -0700 bill-gates-suggested, to-read, 2021-targets 3.87 2019 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41716904-upheaval?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Upheaval: Turning Points for Nations in Crisis" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1544735124l/41716904._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Jared Diamond<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.87<br/> book published: 2019<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: bill-gates-suggested, to-read, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3008511087?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:17:07 -0800 The Idiot https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3008511087?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 12505 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1657539107l/12505._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1657539107l/12505._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1657539107l/12505._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1657539107l/12505._SY475_.jpg Returning to Russia from a sanitarium in Switzerland, the Christ-like epileptic Prince Myshkin finds himself enmeshed in a tangle of love, torn between two women—the notorious kept woman Nastasya and the pure Aglaia—both involved, in turn, with the corrupt, money-hungry Ganya. In the end, Myshkin’s honesty, goodness, and integrity are shown to be unequal to the moral emptiness of those around him.

Even Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould, while extolling the beauty of evolution and examining case studies, have not focused on the evidence itself. Yet the proof is vast, varied, and magnificent, drawn from many different fields of science. Scientists are observing species splitting into two and are finding more and more fossils capturing change in the past—dinosaurs that have sprouted feathers, fish that have grown limbs. <br /><br /><i>Why Evolution Is True</i> weaves together the many threads of modern work in genetics, paleontology, geology, molecular biology, and anatomy that demonstrate the "indelible stamp" of the processes first proposed by Darwin. In crisp, lucid prose accessible to a wide audience, <i>Why Evolution Is True</i> dispels common misunderstandings and fears about evolution and clearly confirms that this amazing process of change has been firmly established as a scientific truth. 282 Jerry A.

Will artificial agents save or destroy us? Nick Bostrom lays the foundation for understanding the future of humanity and intelligent life. <br /><br />The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. If machine brains surpassed human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become extremely powerful—possibly beyond our control. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on humans than on the species itself, so would the fate of humankind depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.<br /><br />But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move.

When you can eat just about anything nature (or the supermarket) has to offer, deciding what you <i>should</i> eat will inevitably stir anxiety, especially when some of the foods on offer might shorten your life. Today, buffered by one food fad after another, America is suffering from what can only be described as a national eating disorder. The omnivore’s dilemma has returned with a vengeance, as the cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet confronts us with a bewildering and treacherous food landscape. What’s at stake in our eating choices is not only our own and our children’s health, but the health of the environment that sustains life on earth.<br /><i>The Omnivore's Dilemma</i> is groundbreaking book, in which one of America’s most fascinating, original, and elegant writers turns his own omnivorous mind to the seemingly straightforward question of what we should have for dinner. The question has confronted us since man discovered fire, but according to Michael Pollan, the bestselling author of <i>The Botany of Desire</i>, how we answer it today, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, may well determine our very survival as a species. Should we eat a fast-food hamburger? Something organic? Or perhaps something we hunt, gather, or grow ourselves? <br />To find out, Pollan follows each of the food chains that sustain us—industrial food, organic or alternative food, and food we forage ourselves—from the source to a final meal, and in the process develops a definitive account of the American way of eating. His absorbing narrative takes us from Iowa cornfields to food-science laboratories, from feedlots and fast-food restaurants to organic farms and hunting grounds, always emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the handful of plant and animal species we depend on. Each time Pollan sits down to a meal, he deploys his unique blend of personal and investigative journalism to trace the origins of everything consumed, revealing what we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods and flavors reflects our evolutionary inheritance.<br />The surprising answers Pollan offers to the simple question posed by this book have profound political, economic, psychological, and even moral implications for all of us. Ultimately, this is a book as much about visionary solutions as it is about problems, and Pollan contends that, when it comes to food, doing the right thing often turns out to be the tastiest thing an eater can do. Beautifully written and thrillingly argued, <i>The Omnivore’s Dilemma</i> promises to change the way we think about the politics and pleasure of eating. For anyone who reads it, dinner will never again look, or taste, quite the same. 450 Michael Pollan 1594200823 Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:10:06 -0800 Wed, 16 Oct 2019 09:10:58 -0700 to-read, 2021-targets 4.18 2006 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3109.The_Omnivore_s_Dilemma?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1393804353l/3109._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Michael Pollan<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.18<br/> book published: 2006<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: to-read, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3008502997?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:09:40 -0800 Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3008502997?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 245344 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432906218l/245344._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432906218l/245344._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432906218l/245344._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432906218l/245344._SY475_.jpg In a book that Business Insider noted as one of the "14 Books that inspired Elon Musk," J.E. Gordon strips engineering of its confusing technical terms, communicating its founding principles in accessible, witty prose.<br /><br />For anyone who has ever wondered why suspension bridges don't collapse under eight lanes of traffic, how dams hold back--or give way under--thousands of gallons of water, or what principles guide the design of a skyscraper, a bias-cut dress, or a kangaroo, this book will ease your anxiety and answer your questions.<br /><br /> Or Why Things Don't Fall Down is an informal explanation of the basic forces that hold together the ordinary and essential things of this world--from buildings and bodies to flying aircraft and eggshells. In a style that combines wit, a masterful command of his subject, and an encyclopedic range of reference, Gordon includes such chapters as "How to Design a Worm" and "The Advantage of Being a Beam," offering humorous insights in human and natural creation.<br /><br />Architects and engineers will appreciate the clear and cogent explanations of the concepts of stress, shear, torsion, fracture, and compression. If you're building a house, a sailboat, or a catapult, here is a handy tool for understanding the mechanics of joinery, floors, ceilings, hulls, masts--or flying buttresses.<br /><br />Without jargon or oversimplification, Structures opens up the marvels of technology to anyone interested in the foundations of our everyday lives. 395 J.E.

In How to Create a Mind , Kurzweil presents a provocative exploration of the most important project in human-machine civilization—reverse engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works and using that knowledge to create even more intelligent machines.<br /><br />Kurzweil discusses how the brain functions, how the mind emerges from the brain, and the implications of vastly increasing the powers of our intelligence in addressing the world’s problems. He thoughtfully examines emotional and moral intelligence and the origins of consciousness and envisions the radical possibilities of our merging with the intelligent technology we are creating.<br /><br />Certain to be one of the most widely discussed and debated science books of the year, How to Create a Mind is sure to take its place alongside Kurzweil’s previous classics which include Fantastic Voyage: Live Long Enough to Live Forever and The Age of Spiritual Machines . 336 Ray Kurzweil 0670025291 Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:08:33 -0800 Thu, 02 Apr 2020 22:30:51 -0700 to-read, 2021-targets 3.95 2012 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13589153-how-to-create-a-mind?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="How to Create a Mind: The Secret of Human Thought Revealed" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355117137l/13589153._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Ray Kurzweil<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.95<br/> book published: 2012<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: to-read, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3014682750?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:08:08 -0800 Consciousness Explained https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3014682750?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 2069 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924714l/2069._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924714l/2069._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924714l/2069._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924714l/2069.jpg "Brilliant...as audacious as its title....Mr. Dennett's exposition is nothing short of brilliant." --George Johnson, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br /><br /><i>Consciousness Explained</i> is a a full-scale exploration of human consciousness.

Now what was once solely the province of science fiction has become a startling reality. Recording memories, telepathy, videotaping our dreams, mind control, avatars, and telekinesis are not only possible; they already exist.<br /> <br /><i>The Future of the Mind</i> gives us an authoritative and compelling look at the astonishing research being done in top laboratories around the world—all based on the latest advancements in neuroscience and physics. One day we might have a "smart pill" that can enhance our cognition; be able to upload our brain to a computer, neuron for neuron; send thoughts and emotions around the world on a "brain-net"; control computers and robots with our mind; push the very limits of immortality; and perhaps even send our consciousness across the universe. <br /> <br />Dr. Kaku takes us on a grand tour of what the future might hold, giving us not only a solid sense of how the brain functions but also how these technologies will change our daily lives. He even presents a radically new way to think about "consciousness" and applies it to provide fresh insight into mental illness, artificial intelligence and alien consciousness. <br /><br />With Dr. Kaku's deep understanding of modern science and keen eye for future developments, <i>The Future of the Mind</i> is a scientific tour de force--an extraordinary, mind-boggling exploration of the frontiers of neuroscience. 377 Michio Kaku 038553082X Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:07:09 -0800 Thu, 01 Jan 2015 21:17:29 -0800 to-read, 2021-targets 4.07 2014 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17978489-the-future-of-the-mind?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Future of the Mind: The Scientific Quest to Understand, Enhance, and Empower the Mind" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1371428466l/17978489._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Michio Kaku<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.07<br/> book published: 2014<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: to-read, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744696082?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:06:44 -0800 The Industries of the Future https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744696082?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 25111341 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1487178301l/25111341._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1487178301l/25111341._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1487178301l/25111341._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1487178301l/25111341.jpg This book answers the question: 'What's next?' The Internet had a world-changing impact on businesses and the global community over the twenty years from 1994 to 2014. In the next ten years, change will happen even faster. <br /><br />As Hillary Clinton's Senior Advisor for Innovation, Alec Ross travelled nearly a million miles to forty-one countries, the equivalent of two round-trips to the moon. From refugee camps in the Congo and Syrian war zones, to visiting the world's most powerful people in business and government, Ross's travels amounted to a four-year masterclass in the changing nature of innovation. <br /><br />In The Industries of the Future, Ross distils his observations on the forces that are changing the world. He highlights the best opportunities for progress and explains how countries thrive or sputter. Ross examines the specific fields that will most shape our economic future over the next ten years, including robotics, artificial intelligence, the commercialization of genomics, cybercrime and the impact of digital technology. <br /><br />Blending storytelling and economic analysis, he answers questions on how we will need to adapt. Ross gives readers a vivid and informed perspective on how sweeping global trends are affecting the ways we live, now and tomorrow. 320 Alec J.

The son of two KGB agents and the product of the best Soviet institutions, the savvy, sophisticated Gordievsky grew to see his nation’s communism as both criminal and philistine.<br /><br />He took his first posting for Russian intelligence in 1968 and eventually became the Soviet Union’s top man in London, but from 1973 on he was secretly working for MI6. For nearly a decade, as the Cold War reached its twilight, Gordievsky helped the West turn the tables on the KGB, exposing Russian spies and helping to foil countless intelligence plots, as the Soviet leadership grew increasingly paranoid at the United States’s nuclear first-strike capabilities and brought the world closer to the brink of war. Desperate to keep the circle of trust close, MI6 never revealed Gordievsky’s name to its counterparts in the CIA, which in turn grew obsessed with figuring out the identity of Britain’s obviously top-level source. Their obsession ultimately doomed Gordievsky: the CIA officer assigned to identify him was none other than Aldrich Ames, the man who would become infamous for secretly spying for the Soviets.<br /><br />Unfolding the delicious three-way gamesmanship between America, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and culminating in the gripping cinematic beat-by-beat of Gordievsky’s nail-biting escape from Moscow in 1985, Ben Macintyre has crafted an electrifying account of an international hero. Like the greatest novels of John le Carré, The Spy and the Traitor brings readers deep into a world of treachery and betrayal, where the lines bleed between the personal and the professional, and one man’s hatred of communism had the power to change the future of nations. 384 Ben Macintyre 0771060335 Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:05:46 -0800 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:05:42 -0800 to-read, 2021-targets 4.48 2018 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37542581-the-spy-and-the-traitor?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Spy and the Traitor: The Greatest Espionage Story of the Cold War" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1522906662l/37542581._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Ben Macintyre<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.48<br/> book published: 2018<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: to-read, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744690878?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:04:59 -0800 The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744690878?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 51187948 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1722528916l/51187948._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1722528916l/51187948._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1722528916l/51187948._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1722528916l/51187948.jpg "The #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Devil in the White City and Dead Wake delivers a fresh and compelling portrait of Winston Churchill and London during the Blitz.<br /><br /> On Winston Churchill's first day as prime minister, Hitler invaded Holland and Belgium. Poland and Czechoslovakia had already fallen, and the Dunkirk evacuation was just two weeks away. For the next twelve months, Hitler would wage a relentless bombing campaign, killing 45,000 Britons. It was up to Churchill to hold the country together and persuade President Franklin Roosevelt that Britain was a worthy ally-and willing to fight to the end. <br /><br />In The Splendid and the Vile, Erik Larson shows, in cinematic detail, how Churchill taught the British people "the art of being fearless." It is a story of political brinkmanship, but it's also an intimate domestic drama set against the backdrop of Churchill's prime-ministerial country home, Chequers; his wartime retreat, Ditchley, where he and his entourage go when the moon is brightest and the bombing threat is highest; and of course 10 Downing Street in London. <br /><br />Drawing on diaries, original archival documents, and once-secret intelligence reports-some released only recently-Larson provides a new lens on London's darkest year through the day-to-day experience of Churchill and his wife, Clementine; their youngest daughter, Mary, who chafes against her parents' wartime protectiveness; their son, Randolph, and his beautiful, unhappy wife, Pamela; Pamela's illicit lover, a dashing American emissary; and the cadre of close advisers who comprised Churchill's "Secret Circle," including his lovestruck private secretary, John Colville; newspaper baron Lord Beaverbrook; and the Rasputin-like Frederick Lindemann. <br /><br />The Splendid and the Vile takes readers out of today's political dysfunction and back to a time of true leadership, when-in the face of unrelenting horror-Churchill's eloquence, courage, and perseverance bound a country, and a family, together."-- 546 Erik Larson 038534872X Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:04:59 -0800 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:04:56 -0800 to-read, 2021-targets 4.30 2020 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51187948-the-splendid-and-the-vile?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Splendid and the Vile: A Saga of Churchill, Family, and Defiance During the Blitz" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1722528916l/51187948._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Erik Larson<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.30<br/> book published: 2020<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: to-read, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744689726?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:04:36 -0800 Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744689726?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 41795733 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550048292l/41795733._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550048292l/41795733._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550048292l/41795733._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550048292l/41795733.jpg What's the most effective path to success in any domain? It's not what you think. <br /><b> <br /> </b>Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the people who got a head start. But a closer look at research on the world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel laureates, shows that early specialization is the exception, not the rule.<br /><br />David Epstein examined the world's most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make connections their more specialized peers can't see.<br /><br />Provocative, rigorous, and engrossing, <i>Range</i> makes a compelling case for actively cultivating inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn. Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening their knowledge in a single area. As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive. 339 David Epstein 0735214484 Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:04:36 -0800 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:04:34 -0800 to-read, 2021-targets 4.12 2019 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550048292l/41795733._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: David Epstein<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.12<br/> book published: 2019<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: to-read, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3008504687?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:04:12 -0800 Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3008504687?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 34272565 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499718864l/34272565._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499718864l/34272565._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499718864l/34272565._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1499718864l/34272565._SX318_.jpg <b>How will Artificial Intelligence affect crime, war, justice, jobs, society and our very sense of being human?

In the days and weeks that followed, Fang Fang's nightly postings gave voice to the fears, frustrations, anger, and hope of missions of her fellow citizens, reflecting on the psychological impact of forced isolation, the role of internet as both community lifeline and source of misinformation, and most tragically, the lives of neighbors and friends taken by the deadly virus.<br /><br />A fascinating eyewitness account of events as they unfold, 'WUHAN DIARY' captures the challenges of daily life as changing moods and emotions of being quarantined without reliable information. Fang Fang finds solace in small domestic comforts and is inspired by the courage of friends, health professionals and volunteers, as well as the resilience and perseverance of Wuhan's nine million residents. But, by claiming the writer's duty to record she also speaks out against social injustice, abuse of power, and other problems which impeded the response to the epidemic and gets herself embroiled in online controversies because of it.<br /><br />As Fang Fang documents the beginning of the global health crisis in real time, we are able to identify patterns and mistakes that many of the countries dealing with the novel coronavirus have later repeated. She reminds us that, in the face of the new virus, the plight of the citizens of Wuhan is also that of citizens everywhere. As Fang Fang writes: "The virus is the common enemy of humankind; that is a lesson for all humanity. The only way we can conquer this virus and free ourselves from its grip is for all members of humankind to work together."<br /><br />Blending the intimate and the epic, the profound and the quotidian, 'WUHAN DIARY' is a remarkable record of an extraordinary time. 380 Fang Fang 0063052636 Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:03:43 -0800 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:03:41 -0800 to-read, 2021-targets 3.52 2020 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52849406-wuhan-diary?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Wuhan Diary: Dispatches from a Quarantined City" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586146994l/52849406._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Fang Fang<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.52<br/> book published: 2020<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: to-read, 2021-targets<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744684311?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:02:59 -0800 Confessions of an Advertising Man https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3744684311?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 44895 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388252662l/44895._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388252662l/44895._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388252662l/44895._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388252662l/44895.jpg David Ogilvy was an advertising genius.

Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective—the story of one man’s bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of “hope and change,” and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible.<br /><br />This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama’s conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day. 768 Barack Obama 1524763187 Gaurav 0 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:02:27 -0800 Sun, 03 Jan 2021 20:02:22 -0800 2021-targets, to-read 4.31 2020 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55361205-a-promised-land?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="A Promised Land" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1600357110l/55361205._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Barack Obama<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.31<br/> book published: 2020<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2021/01/03<br/> shelves: 2021-targets, to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3004407786?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 31 Dec 2020 12:22:39 -0800 What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3004407786?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 21413662 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451351509l/21413662._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451351509l/21413662._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451351509l/21413662._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451351509l/21413662._SX318_.jpg Fans of the <i>xkcd</i> comic ask Munroe a lot of strange questions: What if you tried to hit a baseball pitched at 90 percent the speed of light? How fast can you hit a speed bump while driving and live? If there was a robot apocalypse, how long would humanity last? What if everyone only had one soulmate? What would happen if the moon went away?<br /><br />In pursuit of answers, Munroe runs computer simulations, pores over stacks of declassified military research memos, solves differential equations, and consults with nuclear reactor operators. His responses are masterpieces of clarity and hilarity, complemented by his signature <i>xkcd</i> comics. (They often predict the complete annihilation of humankind, or at least a really big explosion.)<br /><br />In celebration of 10 years of unusual insight, Randall Munroe has revised his classic blockbuster to ask what if? x 10. The result is 10x the adventure of scientific inquiry. Featuring brand-new 2-color annotations and illustrations, this special anniversary edition is far more than a book for geeks, <i>What If?</i> explains the laws of science in operation in a way that every intelligent reader will enjoy and feel much smarter for having read. 303 Randall Munroe 0544272994 Gaurav 0 Thu, 31 Dec 2020 12:22:39 -0800 Mon, 07 Oct 2019 10:44:08 -0700 bill-gates-suggested 4.13 2014 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413662-what-if?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="What If?: Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451351509l/21413662._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Randall Munroe<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.13<br/> book published: 2014<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2020/12/31<br/> shelves: bill-gates-suggested<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3678899877?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sat, 05 Dec 2020 08:29:02 -0800 Between Queens and the Cities https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3678899877?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 55895180 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1605505010l/55895180._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1605505010l/55895180._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1605505010l/55895180._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1605505010l/55895180._SY475_.jpg Between Queens and the Cities is the riveting tale of a 19-year-old Nepali gay man and his long journey from Kathmandu to New York and back. Set against the backdrop of contemporary Nepal, the author reveals, with elan and ease, queer spaces where friendships are fostered outside the normalcy accorded to family and marriage. In the process, he introduces many fellow travellers of the LGBTIQ community. With rare courage and outrageous emotional honesty, the author lays bare the ceaseless conflict of the mind and heart in exploring sexuality. He also compels the reader to interrogate dominant notions regarding love and longing and in doing so, reveals dynamic relationships that are not confined to the realm of queer intimacy alone. This memoir on the shaping of queer identity in the South Asian context bristles with deeper questions regarding belonging. <br />“By showing us how he negotiated a life for himself, Kunwar helps queer Nepalis reimagine their lives anew. He also shows all of us Nepali society as we have never seen it before: young, dynamic, open, and urbane. There is hope yet for social change.” -Manjushree Thapa, Author of Forget Kathmandu<br />“Brave and beautifully written.” --Samrat Upadhyay, Author of Arresting God in Kathmandu 324 Niranjan Kunwar Gaurav 4 Sat, 05 Dec 2020 08:29:02 -0800 Sat, 05 Dec 2020 08:28:37 -0800 A great read. 3.84 2020 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55895180-between-queens-and-the-cities?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Between Queens and the Cities" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1605505010l/55895180._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Niranjan Kunwar<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.84<br/> book published: 2020<br/> rating: 4<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2020/12/05<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/>A great read.<br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/972593634?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Fri, 06 Nov 2020 10:16:24 -0800 The Mahābhārata https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/972593634?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 6367153 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1710806911l/6367153._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1710806911l/6367153._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1710806911l/6367153._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1710806911l/6367153._SY475_.jpg Centuries ago, it was proclaimed of the Mahabharata: "What is not in it, is nowhere." But even now, we can use the same words about it. He who knows it not, knows not the heights and depths of the soul; he misses the trials and tragedy and the beauty and grandeur of life. <br />The Mahabharata is not a mere epic; it is a romance, telling the tale of heroic men and women, and of some who were divine; it is a whole literature in itself, containing a code of life, a philosophy of social and ethical relations, and speculative thought on human problems that is hard to rival; but, above all, it has for its core the Gita,which is, as the world is beginning to find out, the noblest of scriptures and the grandest of sagas in which the climax is reached in the wondrous apocalypse in the Eleventh Canto. 912 Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa 0140446818 Gaurav 4 Fri, 06 Nov 2020 10:16:24 -0800 Fri, 20 Jun 2014 04:45:35 -0700 4.21 1951 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6367153-the-mah-bh-rata?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Mahābhārata" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1710806911l/6367153._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.21<br/> book published: 1951<br/> rating: 4<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2020/11/06<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3606411835?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Wed, 21 Oct 2020 11:21:55 -0700 The Windup Girl https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3606411835?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 6597651 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1278940608l/6597651._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1278940608l/6597651._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1278940608l/6597651._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1278940608l/6597651.jpg Anderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's Calorie Man in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko... <br /><br />Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe. <br /><br />What Happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution?

Losing means certain death. The Hunger Games have begun. . . .<br /><br />In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen regards it as a death sentence when she steps forward to take her sister's place in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. 374 Suzanne Collins 0439023483 Gaurav 0 Wed, 21 Oct 2020 11:21:21 -0700 Wed, 21 Oct 2020 11:21:21 -0700 15-most-important-science-fiction-b 4.34 2008 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Hunger Games (The Hunger Games, #1)" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1586722975l/2767052._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Suzanne Collins<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.34<br/> book published: 2008<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2020/10/21<br/> shelves: 15-most-important-science-fiction-b<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3488062153?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 09 Aug 2020 20:20:08 -0700 Money for Nothing: The Scientists, Fraudsters, and Corrupt Politicians Who Reinvented Money, Panicked a Nation, and Made the World Rich https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3488062153?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 52128986 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577252653l/52128986._SX50_SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577252653l/52128986._SX50_SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577252653l/52128986._SX98_SY160_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577252653l/52128986._SX318_SY475_.jpg <b>The sweeping story of how the greatest minds of the Scientific Revolution applied their new ideas to people, money, and markets--and along the way, invented modern finance.</b><br /><br /><i>Money for Nothing </i>chronicles the moment when the needs of war, discoveries of natural philosophy, and ambitions of investors collided. It's about how the Scientific Revolution intertwined with finance to set England--and the world--off in an entirely new direction.<br /><br />At the dawn of the eighteenth century, England was running out of money due to a prolonged war with France. Parliament tried raising additional funds by selling debt to its citizens, taking in money now with the promise of interest later. It was the first permanent national debt, but still they needed more. They turned to the stock market--a relatively new invention itself--where Isaac Newton's new mathematics of change over time, which he applied to the motions of the planets and the natural world, were fast being applied to the world of money. What kind of future returns could a person expect on an investment today? The Scientific Revolution could help. In the hub of London's stock market--Exchange Alley--the South Sea Company hatched a scheme to turn pieces of the national debt into shares of company stock, and over the spring of 1720 the plan worked brilliantly. Stock prices doubled, doubled again, and then doubled once more, getting everyone in London from tradespeople to the Prince of Wales involved in money mania that consumed the people, press, and pocketbooks of the empire.<br /><br />Unlike science, though, with its tightly controlled experiments, the financial revolution was subject to trial and error on a grand scale, with dramatic, sometimes devastating, consequences for people's lives. With England at war and in need of funds and "stock-jobbers" looking for any opportunity to get in on the action, this new world of finance had the potential to save the nation--but only if it didn't bankrupt it first. 400 Thomas Levenson 0812998464 Gaurav 0 Sun, 09 Aug 2020 20:20:08 -0700 Sun, 09 Aug 2020 20:20:08 -0700 to-read 3.88 2020 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52128986-money-for-nothing?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="Money for Nothing: The Scientists, Fraudsters, and Corrupt Politicians Who Reinvented Money, Panicked a Nation, and Made the World Rich" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1577252653l/52128986._SX50_SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Thomas Levenson<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 3.88<br/> book published: 2020<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2020/08/09<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3463128213?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Sun, 26 Jul 2020 11:08:43 -0700 The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3463128213?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 96884 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348779688l/96884._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348779688l/96884._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348779688l/96884._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348779688l/96884.jpg In his widely praised book, award-winning psychologist Jonathan Haidt examines the world’s philosophical wisdom through the lens of psychological science, showing how a deeper understanding of enduring maxims-like Do unto others as you would have others do unto you, or What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger-can enrich and even transform our lives. 297 Jonathan Haidt 0465028020 Gaurav 0 Sun, 26 Jul 2020 11:08:43 -0700 Sun, 26 Jul 2020 11:08:43 -0700 to-read 4.07 2006 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/96884.The_Happiness_Hypothesis?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348779688l/96884._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Jonathan Haidt<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.07<br/> book published: 2006<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2020/07/26<br/> shelves: to-read<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3446209590?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Thu, 16 Jul 2020 11:35:11 -0700 Long Walk to Freedom: Volume 1 https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3446209590?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 9021 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348440647l/9021._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348440647l/9021._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348440647l/9021._SY160_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348440647l/9021.jpg From his birth in a village on the banks of the Mbashe River in the Transkei to his politicisation and development as a freedom fighter, this first volume of Nelson Mandela's classic autobiography charts the early years of his life, which culminated in his prison sentence in 1962.

The presentation of the novel is great and the readers are bound to move along with the characters in the story.<br /><br /><br />The story starts with the short narration related with the story of the birth of the son, Brishabahadur. The book is divided into eleven parts, each mentioned as a day. The novel is part present and more of a flashback. The narrator, who himself is the writer, comes to visit his father and during the eleven days that he spends taking care of his sick father, his mind drifts towards the past. The changing perception of the son regarding his father is expressed beautifully in this novel. 384 Buddhisagar Gaurav 0 Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:44:52 -0700 Tue, 14 Jul 2020 07:44:38 -0700 4.23 2010 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10579909-karnali-blues?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="कर्नाली ब्लुज [Karnali Blues]" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1298524190l/10579909._SX50_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Buddhisagar<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.23<br/> book published: 2010<br/> rating: 0<br/> read at: <br/> date added: 2020/07/14<br/> shelves: <br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2760562115?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Wed, 08 Jul 2020 21:05:49 -0700 The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting up a Generation for Failure https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2760562115?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 36556202 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1513836885l/36556202._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1513836885l/36556202._SY75_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1513836885l/36556202._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1513836885l/36556202._SY475_.jpg Something is going wrong on many college campuses in the last few years. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicide are rising. Speakers are shouted down. Students and professors say they are walking on eggshells and afraid to speak honestly. How did this happen?<br /> <br />First Amendment expert Greg Lukianoff and social psychologist Jonathan Haidt show how the new problems on campus have their origins in three terrible ideas that have become increasingly woven into American childhood and what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker; always trust your feelings; and life is a battle between good people and evil people. These three Great Untruths are incompatible with basic psychological principles, as well as ancient wisdom from many cultures. They interfere with healthy development. Anyone who embraces these untruths—and the resulting culture of safetyism—is less likely to become an autonomous adult able to navigate the bumpy road of life.<br /> <br />Lukianoff and Haidt investigate the many social trends that have intersected to produce these untruths. They situate the conflicts on campus in the context of America’s rapidly rising political polarization, including a rise in hate crimes and off-campus provocation. They explore changes in childhood including the rise of fearful parenting, the decline of unsupervised play, and the new world of social media that has engulfed teenagers in the last decade.<br /> <br />This is a book for anyone who is confused by what is happening on college campuses today, or has children, or is concerned about the growing inability of Americans to live, work, and cooperate across party lines. 352 Jonathan Haidt 0735224900 Gaurav 4 Wed, 8 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000 Wed, 08 Jul 2020 21:05:49 -0700 Sat, 23 Mar 2019 08:25:35 -0700 samharris-recos 4.23 2018 <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36556202-the-coddling-of-the-american-mind?utm_medium=api&amp;utm_source=rss"><img alt="The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting up a Generation for Failure" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1513836885l/36556202._SY75_.jpg" /></a><br/> author: Jonathan Haidt<br/> name: Gaurav<br/> average rating: 4.23<br/> book published: 2018<br/> rating: 4<br/> read at: 2020/07/08<br/> date added: 2020/07/08<br/> shelves: samharris-recos<br/> review: <br/><br/> https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/944629216?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss Mon, 08 Jun 2020 23:04:33 -0700 A Little History of the World https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/944629216?utm_medium=api&utm_source=rss 61505 https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388179842l/61505._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388179842l/61505._SX50_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388179842l/61505._SX98_.jpg https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388179842l/61505.jpg In 1935, with a doctorate in art history and no prospect of a job, the 26-year-old Ernst Gombrich was invited by a publishing acquaintance to attempt a history of the world for younger readers. Amazingly, he completed the task in an intense six weeks, and <i>Eine kurze Weltgeschichte für junge Leser</i> was published in Vienna to immediate success, and is now available in seventeen languages across the world. Toward the end of his long life, Gombrich embarked upon a revision and, at last, an English translation. <i>A Little History of the World</i> presents his lively and involving history to English-language readers for the first time. Superbly designed and freshly illustrated, this is a book to be savored and collected. In forty concise chapters, Gombrich tells the story of man from the stone age to the atomic bomb. In between emerges a colorful picture of wars and conquests, grand works of art, and the spread and limitations of science. This is a text dominated not by dates and facts, but by the sweep of mankind's experience across the centuries, a guide to humanity's achievements and an acute witness to its frailties.

Much greater than space travel or perhaps even the next revolutionary medical breakthrough, what is at stake is the whole idea of the good life as we have known it.<br /><br />Immigration and inequality, globalization and technological disruption, slowing growth and accelerating climate change--these are sources of great anxiety across the world, from New Delhi and Dakar to Paris and Washington, DC. The resources to address these challenges are there--what we lack are ideas that will help us jump the wall of disagreement and distrust that divides us. If we succeed, history will remember our era with gratitude; if we fail, the potential losses are incalculable.<br /><br />In this revolutionary book, renowned MIT economists Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo take on this challenge, building on cutting-edge research in economics explained with lucidity and grace. Original, provocative, and urgent, <i>Good Economics for Hard Times</i> makes a persuasive case for an intelligent interventionism and a society built on compassion and respect and show how economics, when done right, can help us solve the thorniest social and political problems of the day. It is an extraordinary achievement, one that shines a light to help us appreciate and understand our precariously balanced world. 417 Abhijit V.

Morale had deteriorated, competition was more intense, and technology was changing faster than at any time in the company's history. "I knew there was nothing to be gained from arguing over the past," Iger writes. "The only thing that mattered was the future, and I believed I had a clear idea of the direction Disney needed to go." It came down to three clear ideas: 1) Create the highest quality content Disney could produce. 2) Embrace and adopt technology instead of fighting it. And 3) Think bigger--think global--and turn Disney into a stronger brand in international markets.<br /><br />Twelve years later, Disney is the largest, most respected media company in the world counting Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and 21st Century Fox among its properties. Its value is nearly five times what it was when Iger took over, and Iger is recognized as one of the most innovative and successful CEOs of our time.<br /><br />Now, he's sharing the lessons he's learned while running Disney and leading its 200,000 employees--taking big risks in the face of historic disruption; learning to inspire the people who work for you; leading with fairness and communicating principles clearly. This book is about the relentless curiosity that has driven Iger for forty-five years, since the day he started as a studio supervisor at ABC. It's also about thoughtfulness and respect, and a decency-over-dollars approach that has become the bedrock of every project and partnership Iger pursues, from a deep friendship with Steve Jobs in his final years to an abiding love of the evolving <i>Star Wars</i> myth.<br /><br />"Over the past fourteen years, I think I've learned so much about what real leadership is," Iger writes. "But I couldn't have articulated all of this until I lived it. You can't fake it--and that's one of the key lessons in this book."<br /><br /><i><b>Librarian Note:</b> This is an Advance Reader Copy issued with ISBN 9780399592096.

and into the Age of Democracy:<br />* The French Revolution---from the storming of the Bastille to the guillotining of the King<br />* The revolution's leaders Danton, Desmoulins, Robespierre, Saint-Just---all cut down by the reign of terror they inaugurated.<br />* Napoleon's meteoric rise---from the provincial Corsican military student to the Emperor commanding the largest army in history<br />* Napoleon's fall---his army's destruction in the snows of Russia, his exile to Elba, escape and reconquest of the throne, and ultimate defeat at Waterloo by the combined forces of Europe.<br />* The birth of romanticism and the dawning of a new age of active democracy and a rising middle class, laying the foundation for our own era. 870 Will Durant 1567310222 Gaurav 0 Sun, 17

https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1549393502l/43848929._SX318_.jpg <b>Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller <i>Outliers</i>, offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they often go wrong.</b><br /><br />How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?<br /><br />While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's "Hell You Talmbout."<br /><br />Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world. 388 Malcolm Gladwell 0316478520 Gaurav 4 Sun, 26 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000 Sun, 26 Apr 2020 19:20:37 -0700 Sun, 01 Mar 2020 00:13:12 -0800 MG presents his thesis with varied examples.
